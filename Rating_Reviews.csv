0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
3,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
4,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
5,4,"For the peoples who R going to buy R they buyed this Product. U will Face all this Problems 1) Performance of the laptop is so slow 2) Booting time takes 40 sec coz of HDD 3)When u will play Heavy games like Gta 5 of pubg it will lag like A hell 4) Apps opening and closing time is soo slow and Feels like the laptop is lagging and performing Very slow. 5) Whenever u will game on It, The laptop will automatically Get lock and Restart.  Okay Now SolUTion For all of This -  1) Update ur Laptop to..."
6,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
7,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
8,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
9,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
10,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
11,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
12,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
13,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
14,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
15,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
16,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
17,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
18,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
19,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
20,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
21,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
22,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
23,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
24,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
25,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
26,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
33,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
34,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
35,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
36,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
37,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
38,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
39,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
40,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
41,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
42,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
43,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
44,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
45,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
46,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
47,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
48,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
49,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
50,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
51,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
52,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
53,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
54,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
55,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
56,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
57,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
58,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
59,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
62,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
64,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
65,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
66,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
67,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
68,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
69,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
70,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•.. Overall the laptop is beast because of Nividia GTX 1650 graphics üî•üî•..go for it don't hesitate to buy it's a beast for this price range and...
71,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
72,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."
73,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available
74,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
75,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
76,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
77,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
78,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
79,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
80,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
81,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
82,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
83,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
84,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
85,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5. Rygen 5 Performance is great.  Cons : 1. No Microsoft life usability. It will ask you a license key. 2. Battery lif...
86,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
87,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected. Pros: Best Display best nvidia graphic card ryzen 5 chipset Compact attractive b..."
88,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
89,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
90,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
91,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
92,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram
93,4,I using this laptop from three months. Autocad software are not running smooth. There are lagging problem for heavy autocad work so for autocad or 3 d software this laptop is avarage
94,3,"My initial product had to be replaced because of various issues, I believe I have recieved a product that was returned by someone else.  It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow. Second, updated windows and drivers.  Performance is ok and I'm not rating good because, the load time is very high but once wha..."

98,5,"It needs upgrade as 2.1 gb of ram is reserved by the GPU itself, so your left with 6 gb of usable ram which bottlenecks gaming, so I upgraded with another 8gb of the same ram make for dual channeling and a samsung 1TB SSD, works smooth which few seconds of boot up and load up of games. Heating is slightly on a higher side, fan loudness is acceptable and battery is ; there's no way to say it but mediocre.  But overall with the updates I have no issues with this laptop, sound quality is good, d..."
99,4,"I am using this laptop for three months. It has only hdd storage, due to that the system was very slow. For boot time it takes almost 3min. Unable to do multitasking. All the operations like copy, paste,file unzipping takes more than 2hours. So within one week I have added sdd storage, since it has the compartment for sdd(cost:3k).Now it's super cool laptop at this price. I can able to do multitasking. I didn't faced any issue after that. If you are ready to spend extra 3k for this laptop you..."

Without SSD its very slow, but yiu can still run a lot of things on it, just that yiu have to wait longer on loading screens. My boot time before ssd was around 1.5 to 2 mins, after I put Crucial P5 m.2 nvme ssd , now my boot time is 12 to 15 seconds. The display and keybord are perfect.

103,3,I m giving a honest review..I m using this laptop for 1 month now..it's not that much fast as I expected..betery quality is good..when I use c++ or Java it's gives a decent experience..but sometimes it takes so much time to start..
104,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
105,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
106,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
107,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...
108,5,"After upgrading the ram to 16 gb... All games for this specification works fine. I played few games including pubg pc, warzone, gta v , wolfenstein young blood, gears 5 .. all of them work great in this laptop"
109,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
110,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
111,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
112,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
113,5,I just loved it ....It performed beyond my expectations...If you are planning to get a power laptop with sleek and classy design go for .... It will offer you great experience ...You will just love it..
114,3,I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
115,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
116,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching
117,5,At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core
118,4,1)i liked it very much because of its design fabulus 2)dispaly was good and bright &veuvienig angles were also good at that price range 3)performace was excelent and it also come with 4gb nvidia gtx 1650 grafix card which can handle the heavy games &softwares easily 4)booting time is little bit late when compare with SSD laptop because it comes only with HDD the good thing is we can easily upgrade the storage with help of SSD up to 1TB 5)we can also upgrade RAM upto 16 gb and it comes with 8...
119,4,"The Product is Good Not Best. There are 2 Problems here, One with Ram and One with HDD. Well Ram issue is not the big issue Here, Games are still Playable. For Those who don't Know out of 8 Gb 2.1 GB of Ram is totally occupied by The Vram of the Cpu, So u are left with 5.88 GB of Ram. Now The game still runs like GTA 5.  But The Issue comes with HDD being 5400 Rpm its less. Its Pc performance degrades. You will see windows starting little late, application taking time to open. Also GTA 5 st..."
120,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
121,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."
122,4,Ok So first don't trust on my english i hope you people can understand.  I review this laptop after 1 month of use i purchase this laptop on 3rd December 2020 today is 3rd jan 2021.

123,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
124,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
125,5,"Wonderful gaming laptop,upgrade the ram to 16gb but it supports until 32gb , ssd then this absolute stunning machine, coding wise this doesnt lag even a little bit. gaming still havent tested yet but the nvidia graphics card 1650 is really awesome , 4k videos run cool"
126,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected. All total you can go with this laptop but later you have to buy ssd and ram for ..."
127,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
128,4,"Honestly, this is a good laptop for multitasking and heavy gaming. But it also has some issues which is need to fixed. I highly suggest you to upgrade RAM (16GB) and SSD.  PROS: 1. Can play latest games like Red Dead Redemption at high graphics (30 fps) and GTA 5 which runs as smooth as butter at 60 fps at ultra settings. 2. Suitable for multitasking. 3. Gives high performance and a lag free smooth experience.  CONS: 1. Battery life is bad in this case..."

Lasts 3.30-4 hrs once charged fully. 4) HP support is appreciable i.e after service 5) Value for money n best at this price.  Cons:- 1) Hard disk rpm is less like 5000 ..."
132,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
133,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

140,5,Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.

146,5,A pc like this comes in a lifetime!!!! Very Very happy to purchase this . My dream of gaming came true. Games like The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt and specially Grand Theft Auto V runs beautifully. Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that.

157,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
158,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
159,4,"I have reviewed this product after 7 days. First we should update latest version of nvidia gpu and amd Radeon versions and additionally windows updates also. I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings.

Additionally u need 8 gb ram to play high end games without laaging, sluttering and smooth. This laptop have hdd capacity boot up time..."
160,5,Very nice product in this price range.
161,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
162,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
163,5,Beast with beauty
164,5,"This HP laptop is specifically bought for my daughter for her engineering studies as she has to make graphic designs using Solidworks, PTC Creo and Ansys. Ideal computer for Engineering students."
165,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
166,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
167,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
168,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
169,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
170,5,Just wow! üòç
171,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
172,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
173,5,"Best Laptop Ever. I thought the HDD would be slow, but it's booting in 15 seconds. battery backup also fine, I'll Upgrade to SSD and 16 GB ram. it'll be The best ever."
174,5,Let me tell a kutty story .. pay attention Listen to me...this laptop is just awesome naaüòÉ
175,2,Booting is very very slow
176,5,Nice product and nice luking
177,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
178,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
179,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
180,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
181,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
182,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
183,1,I have Changed my review from 5 star to one... DUE TO BUILD QUALITY. AFTER using for 2 weeks. The build of this laptop showed its colours. Its very bad. The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre. They said the build quality is not promising. but laptop is functional. So poor Feel from this laptop. Look wise its good. no issues. But the feel is totally destroyed coz of...
184,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud
185,5,Asowm
186,5,Very good product and less price
187,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.
188,5,Best laptop at this prize range..
189,3,Good product but delay in delivery
190,4,Nice product..
191,4,Nice laptop.

194,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good. Looks premium but it is made full of plastic and one thing I don't like is that p..."
195,5,It's awesome...
196,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.

199,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
200,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
201,1,This laptop is too too slow from 1st day.
202,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
203,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
204,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
205,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
206,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
207,5,Awesome laptop
208,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
209,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
210,4,"Been 4 months since I got this laptop and must say its been very impressive PROS are the price, the monitor(keep in mind I haven't seen a lot of other IPS monitors), the keyboard, The speakers(amazing) Build quality-made of plastic, but the plastic has a good feel Unique design Actually good selection of ports  CONS The above mentioned plastic is good, but it loves getting smudged and picks up fingerprints  HDD can sometimes be surprisingly slow in game loading 8GbB RAM but obv 2GB of th..."
211,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.
212,4,Performance is okay. Sound quality is superb. Display is good. The main disappointment is battery. Battery is draining fast

214,4,It's good.
215,5,Awesome in this price range
216,4,Good üëçüòé
217,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
218,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

265,4,It's look is awesome working good but a little slow as it is HDD. Will update about it performance later.  Update- Pros Working fine 1. battery is still good on normal usage gives 7 hours backup and I don't play games on battery will not recommend anyone to do so plug in then play. 2. Hinges and keys are still in amazing state. 3. Thermal give good cooling. 4. Gets fully charged in 1 hour 45 minutes even is you are using it.  Cons 1. Thermal's outlets vent throws half of the hot air directly ...
266,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
267,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
268,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
269,5,Best laptop in this range with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650

271,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
272,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
273,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
274,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
275,5,Awesome product
276,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
277,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
278,5,Better to put SSD in it
279,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
280,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
281,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
282,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
283,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
284,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product
285,1,Bought the laptop a week ago and it had already started to hang almost every time I switch it on

292,4,An awesome budget gaming laptop having a good processor but HDD makes its quite slow but all over its Excellent
293,4,"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, for gaming this is the best....."
294,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
295,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
296,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
297,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
298,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
299,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
300,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
301,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
302,5,Nice to handle
303,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
304,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
305,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
306,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
307,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
308,5,Great quality and good looking device.
309,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
310,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
311,5,Best in price but must add SSD
312,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
313,3,Awesome product.
314,5,Nice one but require ssd
315,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
316,3,Not bad
317,5,Perfect device in this price range
318,1,"Don't even think to play warzone with this laptop, it just hangs up and you'll be taking an year to come back to home screen."
319,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
320,4,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
321,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
322,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
323,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
324,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
325,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast.."
326,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
327,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."
328,5,Goodüî•üî•
329,5,It's adorable
330,5,Got it at 43.5k in ugadi sale Good laptop and build quality good
331,4,I had installed the SSD coz hdd is slow overall it's good

334,4,"Can't call this a gaming laptop!! It sucks üò°üò°üò° can't play gta5 properly, it lags, fps drops... worst performance!!Really bad experience!"
335,5,Game will run smoothly if charger is connected üòâ
336,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
337,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
338,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
339,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
340,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
341,1,"It's too much slow my dual core laptop load faster then this, shutdown takes 1.30 minutes and apps lagged too much while opening worst experience till now please don't buy, and main point games are lagging while playing"
342,1,The worst purchase I ever made
343,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
344,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
345,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
346,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
347,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
348,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
349,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
350,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
351,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
352,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
353,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
354,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
355,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
356,1,Very very slow.worst product from hp.
357,1,This is very bad please don't buy it
358,4,Good performance.
359,4,Super laptop at this price range...must buy no issues yet...
360,5,"This is a, budget gaming laptop"
361,5,Nice laptop

363,5,If you add SSD then it becomes beast
364,2,"Not good. After idle time close the laptop does not open and have to forcefully shutdown the laptop . Also, taking more time to start and open."
365,1,Bad hp company Westez money
366,5,Excellent
367,1,Not the value of money
368,4,Nice
369,2,2 months it will work nice after that üôÇ
370,2,The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution
371,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
372,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
373,4,Except battery all features are good.
374,5,With extra 512 gb SSD and 8gb ram this laptop is beast under 50k
375,5,I love it just an amazing ....‚ù§Ô∏èüí´
376,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
377,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
378,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
379,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
380,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
381,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
382,5,Very gud product
383,5,Nice but login slow
384,5,Good working
385,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
386,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
387,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
388,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
389,5,Best one
390,4,"Nice performance, almost good"
391,5,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
392,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
393,1,Worst product from HP don't buy this one very very slow
394,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
395,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
396,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
397,5,Best for 3D work
398,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
399,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."
400,5,Overall good performance
401,1,Forget about gaming.. not even good for normal office use.....Very very very very very slow... Waste of money ..
402,5,Absolutely love this laptop!!!!
403,2,Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor
404,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
405,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
406,5,Bad
407,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
408,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
409,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
410,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
411,3,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
412,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
413,2,This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version
414,3,It is good but my delivery boy was very rude
415,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
416,1,"it working very slow , we have to add ssd to working properly, without ssd it is useless"
417,5,Best laptop for College students
418,4,Best laptop for students
419,4,Best laptop in th 50000
420,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
421,5,. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
422,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
423,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
424,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
425,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
426,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
427,1,Very poor performance... takes almost an hour to start That too after restarting after 4-5 times Very slow  Worst laptop ever experienced
428,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
429,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."
430,4,When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good
431,5,Best laptop at this Price range
432,5,Best at this price
433,5,Simply superb !!

436,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
437,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
438,4,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working
439,5,Good
440,5,Just wow
441,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

482,1,"Delivery is much delay ... Buy only for coding and other responses , not for gaming.. I recommend to upgrade ssd for gaming.."
483,5,Added a SSD and now I can't expect a better computer at this price.  You can run it without a SSD as well. But adding one is highly recommended. You get a whole different experience. Totally happy.
484,4,Nice product
485,5,I am very glad to buy this laptop . It is my best laptop till now I buy all of them.
486,4,Nice laptop great......üëå

488,5,Worth for money
489,5,Value for money.and also good product
490,4,"The overall performance is so good,"
491,5,Very good laptop but little slow...design is just amazing..
492,2,Too slow nd charge drain out very soon not worth it!!
493,4,Better to use ssd for fast speed
494,5,Value For Money best laptop ü§©
495,3,Lil bit slow.. Rest everything all right. Moreover the product looks premium w.r.t price segment..
496,3,"I recently purchased this laptop and getting very good performance but having heating issue on right side of keyboard panel and left side of heating vents downside which is more than usual. This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore. It troubles you everytime you use your device. I've no option to return, only replacement is acceptable which worth nothing to me because I think the wh..."
497,5,"Genuine product, trust worthy."
498,4,Overall happy
499,5,Good product.....you can go for it
500,5,It is best laptop for gaming
501,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
502,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
503,3,Not for value for money
504,2,I think it is refreshing
505,2,"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance"
506,5,"Great Machine, Got it for 52k on sale and it is worth every penny, played Doom, Doom Eternal, GTA V, Just Cause and other great titles without even a single lag. go for it without a second thought :)"
507,5,Excellent Performance with this affordable price
508,4,U have to add SSD for better performance. When i switched it on performance was not good as i expected. Bought 250 GB Kingston additional SSD. Now it's good.
509,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
510,5,Fantasticüòç
511,4,It's nice product
512,5,Please provide atleast 128 gb SSD for fast boot .One of the best laptop and gorgeous look.
513,4,Good but little bit slow if you used ssd than it will be okay
514,3,taking too much time to start
515,4,It is good product..

521,3,"After Using This Lappy , Geniune Review  It's working Slow due to Hdd Speed Is 5000Rpm  You Need to Upgrade RAM & NVME SSD"
522,5,Superb
523,5,Great product.
524,5,"Ok , nice Product under 50k range , but please increase your packing quality , this type of packing is not suitable for 50k item"
525,4,It is very good at performance and also best for gaming at this price If you want to buy dont think just go for it.
526,3,Performance not so good without ssd so i prefer to say must buy ssd for it.
527,5,Beauty and Beast üòç Will upgrade RAM Will install 512 GB SSD Worth every penny in this price range ‚úåüèª
528,4,"Slow like hell due to lack of SSD... otherwise it is best in this price range... go for it guys After adding a NVME M.2 SSD, I got better performance"
529,5,This is a good and best laptop
530,5,Nice product from hp. Value for money .
531,5,Best laptop under 60000
532,4,It's ok
533,4,"Build is perfect ,display is good ,battery performance is normal ,speed is value for money üí∞"
534,5,Good
535,5,Good for gaming and Web designing but it takes little more time to start and shutdown
536,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.
537,3,Poor quality of Flipkart packing
538,3,U need to upgrade it by adding more ram and adding and ssd without this lags a lot very slow pc
539,5,Everything is good..
540,5,Perfomace is good only bootup takes time due to hdd bit games run flawless
541,5,Good
542,5,Amazing product just lv it.....performance is awsome... What a display... Lovely....
543,4,good. but noticed lags in it .
544,4,you can purchase it without any hesitation
545,4,Use SSD for even more better performance
546,5,best gaming laptop
547,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
548,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it
549,3,Booting time is high.. I recommend to add an SSD and move windows to it. Otherwise nice laptop for entry level gaming and editing...
550,3,Battery life is too bad
551,5,Good laptop for this price
552,4,Speed is slow compare to others due to HSD however SSD can be further install.Display is very good and keyboard light is also attractive. Over all its good product in this price range.
553,5,Value for money
554,4,Laptop is good for mid graphl
555,3,This is a good product In terms of value for money. But I face a problem which is Slow boot. I write this review after 4 month Continue use. Go for it But Mind it Insert a Ssd for batter experience
556,5,With 8gb ram its really hard to play games. Upgrade to 16 gb for best performance
557,5,Good laptop at all üòäü§üüí•üî•üíØ
558,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"
559,3,Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.
560,5,Looks so premium can't go wrong with this
561,3,"Purchased as per the spec but it takes too much time to boot, recommended to have SSD"

587,5,Wonderful product  It's awesome üëåüëåüëåüî•
588,4,everything is good in this price range.. just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram... and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage.. it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï and while charging the charger getting heated so much.. I dont know it only happens to me or others too..
589,1,"Some games are lagging , i dont know why this is happening. I am not impressed regarding this product. Build quality is not good . heat control is no doubt good. Battery average. Charging cable is too small.. No colours variety is available, disgusting black Colour."
590,5,"Graphics ard is Nice Display is Nice Everythin is nice except 3 points 1. Startup problem (slow) 2. Batter life is too less (2/3 hrs during general use , not gaming) 3. Speaker volume is too low (almost half than other PC)  Every other crieteria is good Value for money Only Battery and Speaker disappointed me.. (Have to buy external speakers or Headphones)"
591,5,This is the best gaming laptop at this rate.. It's performance is very good display is also grate But the only problem is there is no ssd so booting time is slow
592,1,Got a cheap and used product usb ports doesn't work well if you try to transfer any file from mobile or pendrive it will show you 24 hours of time and Internet doesn't work either please don't purchase it from this seller
593,4,"Everything is good except the hdd feels slow,if you are buying this ,buy a 128 gb ssd minimum."
594,2,Everytime i am paying valorant after 3-4 minutes the screen is showing locking & shuts down... After 1 months of use the screen is getting backlight bleeding & dead pixels
595,5,"This is a great laptop, specially for gaming. I played COD World War 2 and Far Cry 5. Amazing experience. You can upgrade it with SSD to. I Highly recommended it."

605,3,No ssd so poor performance boot time 30 sec
606,5,excellent product
607,5,"The booting speed is very low i think add a ssd that problems will be solved. Battery backup is not much as i expected, and the usb ports are only 2 in this laptop that's the one problems i facing, but the laptop is very much better to compared some other products because in this price range gtx 1650 with 4gb graphics card is not available in any other laptops so if you want 60k budget laptop the buy this"
608,5,It's one of the best in the market I bought it and planning to save some money and then add a ram 8 gb stick and an SSD 256 gb and yeah it's awesome value for money.
609,2,"Not performing as expected , 40 - 60% ram utilisation was going for OS , There is minor lag in games too like asphalt 8"
610,4,"It's been two week since i have used it. For a price of 53k it a value deal.  Shadow of tomb raider: 30-40 fps (Medium settings) Witcher 3: Plays flawlessly in medium settings Total war 3k: 30-40fps (medium settings)  Just slap on an extra 8gigs ram and most games would run 30-40fps at medium settings.  Thermals: I played continously for 7-8hrs, it never throttled. Never expected this from a laptop at this price range, really outperforms. :)  Multitasking: Since the ram is limited to 6gb ca..."
611,5,"Everything is perfect but battery is good having average 4to 5hr. Due to absence of ssd it takes 40 sec to boot up ,it can be improved by inserting a ssd."
612,3,"It is a very good laptop. I am writing this review after one week of delivery. I used this laptop and found some cons. The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great."
613,5,Nice product
614,5,"This is an awesome product, hughly recommended!!"
615,3,Good
616,4,Battery performance is good but Charing is too slow. All this are good. Design is very sleek. Color is nice
617,4,"Laptop is good but sound is not good and also reeboot time is too long to start the laptop, otherwise all good specially display is osm"
618,4,A ssd would be a better option. Battery is not as good as other laptop. Performance is not very great. Still.its fine.
619,4,"The product is very good and the performance is best in my opinion, battery life is also last longing according to my need."
620,5,Purchased for my younger son. He is absolutely happy. So I got the value of purchase.
621,5,Great Display and Sound quality .  Overpowered gaming but only problem is that the usable RAM is 5.92 GB.  You can add RAM and the AMD Ryzen 5 is a total beast .  Love the finishing and overall 4.5/5
622,5,Awesome ProductüíØ‚ù§Ô∏è Recommended for UI DESIGNERS!
623,5,This is nice product but I don't have my warranty card
624,5,Super ! Worth each penny
625,5,This is a good gaming laptop under this price range.
626,5,nice
627,5,Fantastic product with fantastic price point...
628,5,"Very nice,, ???"
629,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
630,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
631,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
632,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
633,5,Very slow processor
634,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
635,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring
636,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
637,5,4days of USAGE AND in short. This laptop can be used for multitasking(coding apps) and runs fairly smooth...boot time approx 45secs and build is amazing. But there is a sluggish and conventional old laptop feels from the start..Its is kind of slow and in the promotion of the laptop benchmark says COD WARFARE runs at ultra high but the laptop doesn't even run the game smoothly like lobby and all...Gaming experience is bad when its online. Have already updated my bios and all but its pretty bad.
638,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
639,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
640,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times. Even before checked game performance. single HD movie also hanged many time in two hours.  Before buying this laptop please check other laptops in this price range and compare with hardware."
641,1,Very slow laptop
642,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
643,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
644,2,"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.  However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed. I understand this doesn't have an SSD, but even with a Hard Disk, that too with the specs that his Laptop comes with, taking close to 2 minutes or more to get to the Windows 10 logon screen is too much. Moreover after loggi..."
645,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
646,1,Worst product ever I got this product just 4 days ago and after installing GTA V I am getting an fps of only 40 on avg. And on contacting Hp support and Nvidia they just give you steps again n again but none of them work and the settings are NORMAL and all the things are updated. Buy only if you don't have any problems in your life
647,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...
648,4,"Battery drains very fast & this laptop is super slow. The main problem is in this laptop it's take so much time to start (one &half minute maximum) & it's folder opening speed also very slow,"
649,2,"The laptop review is written after a months usage 1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3. Very heavy weighing laptop 4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav..."
650,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
651,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
652,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying
653,2,Very slow laptop
654,1,"I am using this laptop from 15 days plz don't buy this laptop it stop working, I am pissed of plz buy a laptop to your near storyüò¢"
655,1,"Worst product , Device not getting on after installation Just one day of use , laptop turned to be useless"
656,1,Very very slow üòí performance. Slow processor very disappoint
657,1,"Modern laptop need more fast processing ...but my laptop, haha even lots of upgrades I still found it's like 13 processor...it's very slow processing I am a bit unhappy ,it takes nearly 10 minutes to start,...which system now a days take 10 minutes to get in track ."
658,4,Everything is fine best performance but battery drains fast
659,1,Performance is slow
660,4,Best laptop
661,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
662,3,Man this is one of the best but of your gaming in this laptop. 8 gb ram is not enough you have to upgrade to 16 gb ram or directly buy same laptop with 16 gb ram and the most value for money in this laptop is graphics card
663,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
664,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
665,1,Always if you open any program it will show not responding not responding
666,3,"bootup time is around 2 min, horribly slow system"
667,3,If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.
668,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
669,2,"A gaming laptop, which cannot survive browser tabs more than 5, while simple apps are running in the background (Spotify, Trello, Telegram)."
670,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
671,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
672,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
673,1,Battery is week.
674,5,Its very slow boot up time is aprrox 2 minutes also i takes 20 30 seconds to open any application btw good for gaming but very slow
675,2,Please not buy this üôèüèªin 5days it have lots of issues worest battery slow boot time
676,3,Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once
677,2,Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.
678,4,Good working
679,2,Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.
680,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
681,2,I was using this laptop since September 2020 it hang a lot
682,5,"Excellent laptop go for it Screen 5/5 Bettery 4:5/5 ,performance 5/5"
683,4,Avarage
684,4,Very good
685,4,"Some softwares seems to be pixelated. Also, I could notice some lag during the file transfer. Multi tasking is not at most good for 8gb ram. It still has to be more efficient."
686,5,"used very well no issue reported as of now, little bit slow due to HDD."
687,5,Very good product..
688,5,Good
689,4,Battery is not God
690,3,Performance is slow
691,3,Best on this price range
692,4,If u r going for gaming then u should upgrade SSD and Ram then it becomes beast.
693,5,Best for Multitasking and multiprocessing
694,5,Better than expected....üî•‚ù§ awesome product
695,4,"Slow booting up with hdd,, but overall good in price segment..."
696,4,Worth the money
697,5,"This laptop is literally amazing. But, a bit slow cause of hdd.. I'm certain it'll get much faster after adding an ssd."
698,4,The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect
699,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
700,2,"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K."
701,5,"i like this laptop ,used outocad and heavy game smoothly"
702,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
703,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
704,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
705,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
706,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
707,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
708,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
709,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
710,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
711,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
712,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
713,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
714,1,I got a faulty product.
715,5,Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast
716,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
717,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
718,1,It heats so much.... unbearable...third class product of HP. Atleast low budget laptops have good performance but this laptop is so bad. It hangs like hell n then nothing happens. Very bad purchase. Nothing goes right with this laptop when compared to its specifications
719,1,I am using this laptop for about 4 months and it had ruined my experience it is worst thing i have purchased ever  it take about 1 minute to start or boot and still after that it get hanged up  i had run many softwares as an graphic designer and every time it screwed up at every last moment and  as for hp support they always tell to reset the pc on every call and every update never download properly  As for heating concern it heats alot if fans are not given it may explode Very cheap qual...
720,1,The delivery boy was a bit rude ...Design display and battery is good...but it seems a bit slow after updating the drivers it's ok ..booting time is 40-60 sec ..maybe due to less ram(6gb and 2gb Vega graphics) and HDD..after upgrading ram and adding ssd ...This will be a beast... everything else seems good..no heating problem..so if u think about this laptop this is ok and after upgrading with about 6-8k it will give best performance...like if you want any updates ....  After 10 days of u...
721,1,Laptop dead on arrival
722,1,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
723,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
724,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
725,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
726,1,"I'm writing this after using it for 5 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3-5 mins just to switch on (even after minimizing almost all startup apps after consulting HP Customer Service. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable batter..."
727,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
728,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
729,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
730,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
731,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
732,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
733,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
734,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
735,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
736,1,Worst product Very slow
737,1,Never buy a ryzen laptop Better go for i3 Intel it works better
738,1,This laptop is i am using but this is really working are slowly...i am not happy
739,1,Worst product..
740,1,I use this laptop 1 months its performance are soo bad lak problem software very slow working and so many problems
741,1,Physical memory installed is 8.0 GB but out of it only 5.88GB is usable. They have no explanation about this. They haven't mentioned this in their specifications. Think before you buy.
742,1,Too much from the date of purchase..
743,1,hard disk speed is too slow always shows 100% disk usage and games are lagging like hell.
744,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
745,1,Laptop generates lot of heat while using it Lags a lot while playing Gta5 Laptop takes 3minutes to boot up It takes 20-30 seconds to respond for a click when there is no background app running. Performance is much less than an average laptop which is half the cost of this laptop. HP shouldn't call this a gaming laptop at all and the price is way too higher for the poor value delivered.
746,1,Hangs alot. Poor performance. Worst battery. Discharged within every 3 hour. Very poor experience. Even copying a single folder of 10 GB from one drive to another take about 1 hour time
747,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
748,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
749,1,"Very waste product i ever seened before.no customer care support.very very slow .. after 11 days the laptop showing very bad performance.the hp customer cares are not contacting me. After i submit a complaint.very very bad prduct.the flipkart , They do not givinge replacement also.don't by this product."
750,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
751,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
752,5,Best in all way....
753,4,"Good budget gamming laptop from hp,I am happy with this laptop,"
754,1,Better to go for acer aspire 7 or ssd variant...I am Facing lot of issues. Worst perfomamce..
755,1,The worst laptop you can ever buy it has ram issues hp support also not able to fix my solution and you will only get 80 90 fps in valorant
756,5,"If you want a Gaming performance I insist you guys to install a Solid State Drive (SSD).......But if you are a normal user this laptop is really more than enough for your needs.....  Plus Points:- ->Very Good Design ->Less weight compared to other with same specifications ->All in all Laptop ->Elegant backlight  Limitations:- -> As it is Plastic body material, it is very often to get untidy.....frequent cleaning is required -> Always good to install SSD to get beast performance -> Camera cla..."
757,1,Worst Laptop For gaming or daily use too. So much hanging issues and lagging issue and booting issue too.
758,1,"Always hanging, not always showing not responding"
759,5,hard disk is slow...you can install ssd must
760,1,Bit battery backup is low
761,5,"In short I would say, WORTHY!"
762,1,Worst model
763,2,Very slow
764,3,"Laptop is powerful and hardware is best,but the quality of hard disk is so bad,it crash in 1year after buying,i reccomend you to buy the its ssd version or you can upgrade to ssd after buying."
765,4,On this price....good performance ü•≥
766,1,"Laptop is tooo slow on both off and on, lag while watching movies, lag on process, many apps and software are not responding"
767,1,"Very bad item, it's got stuck every time and responding time is tooo large it's totally waste of money pls üôècheck before you buy"
768,5,Value for money
769,5,Should update Ram and Ssd to avoid slow performance. Other than that every thing is good
770,2,"DONT BUY HDD.go for SSD. day 2 laptop got automatically shutdown and when it came up, there is no operating system. I had to buy it for my own money."
771,5,Good Performance Laptop
772,3,All things is good but performance is down when playing games charger heating and lagging during high games
773,5,Satisfied.
774,2,"Slow start ,"
775,4,Worth the money
776,3,It was really nice I like it
777,4,There is one important thing about this laptop that is- If you add more ram upto 16gb and Ssd then this laptop is fantabulous. Warning!: Atleast 12gb of Ram is necessary to Run best of tour games.
778,4,I think because of HDD this product is getting too slow running
779,3,Should buy it.......!
780,4,Good product
781,5,Satisfied with this purchase.. Don't expect much from a ryzen 5 processor but powerful enough for programming and coding.
782,5,Best laptop in this segment
783,5,adipoli product ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥
784,5,Good product
785,5,Worth
786,5,amazing product
787,4,Man you're looking for accounting work laptop..... Then that's perfect for us
788,4,Product was good and worth for Penny
789,2,"Worst Laptop Ever / I haven't Download Such Things Hanging So Much It's 1 Month Review / But Now It's 7month And it's Opening Microsoft , Chrome Speed So Trash"
790,2,"It needs ram and ssd ,afterwards it's best , otherwise it's booting time is so long also, sometimes it may hangs"
791,5,Amazing Laptop for mild gaming...If you are not a professional gamer and just wanna play for fun this lap. is highly recommended...Even good for coding!!...best at this range ...and it's design is just lit!!!..ü§üüî•
792,1,Some of my internal parts are replaced by other quality less old parts .I just found out this today when I just opened it because of its very poor performance and I was shocked.if I found out earlier in the time of before replacement surely replaced it.and I would never buy a another product from Flipkart because then will never hesitate to fool me again
793,5,can we use pentab with this laptop ?
794,3,I work with android studio. But this lap can not run emulators. It a bit laggy than expected. I wont say its bad but could be better. If you are looking to do heavier tasks go for another higer ones.
795,4,Just upgrade with SSD then it's great
796,5,I am using this laptop from last 6 months and I must say it worths. If you are looking for gaming laptop then this laptop will the best option for you. You will neet to upgrade with SSD. You can use it for official work also
797,5,Good
798,5,I love it
799,4,ONE THING . The Warrenty.. Got a new one and instead of 12 months of warrenty it has only 8 months warranty left and . PC opened 4 months ago for just one day and even in your Hp site you cannot dispute the Warrenty issue because HP says it's not a Consumer product but a Business product.. No Idea what to do about this. And also system is slow and gets hanging simultaneously. Display is good. Sound is not good and loud as expected.
800,4,It takes too much time to start
801,5,Good
802,1,‚Ä¢The Processing speed is very slow ‚Ä¢Booting and Loading takes much time ‚Ä¢Overall looks are good   Is this because of the running of automatic windows updates !???
803,1,Not buy this product Buy ssd laptop
804,4,Great design and performance. A bit slow boot time.
805,2,"Worst laptop, very very slow processor don't buy it"
806,5,Best laptop under this price
807,5,Very nice for students and gamers
808,5,Best laptop for gaming design is excellent graphics Premium design decent processor best deal @49k 150w charger super gaming laptop under 50k hp brand quality

812,1,Poor laptop
813,1,In last 6 months it has crashed twice. How can HP make such a product
814,5,Good gaming & design product in budget
815,1,Speed Not good.
816,4,It is a very good laptop. Very good in this price range. Don't have too much expectations as mentioned in some other reviews. Only problem is 5.9 gb ram ( 2.1 gb is reserved for integrated GPU.
817,3,average
818,4,You Must have to upgrade the laptop ram for playing high specs games like GTA V and others. BTW nyc design and performance..
819,4,GOOD FOR GAMING AND VIDEO EDITING.. BUT RAM UPGRADE IS NECESSARY FOR REACHING ITS POTENTIAL... ALSO SSD UPGRADATION FOR FASTER BOOTING TIME AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT..... RYZEN 3550H ITSELF IS A GOOD BUDGET PROCESSOR FOR MEDIUM- HIGH GAMING BUT THE PROCESSOR ITSELF TAKE UP 2GB OF RAM AND THE INSTALLED APPS ALSO CONSUMES MORE THAN HALF OF THE RAM SPACE..WHICH LEFT THE USER ONLY 2-3GB OF SPACE... SO BETTER TO UPGRADE... ITS LACKS LIKE HELL IN JUST STOCK 8GB RAM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS LAPTOP IS...
820,5,Really very good
821,4,Nice performance but sometimes get stuck when am working on my office domain.. I don't think it's good for gaming purpose... I am giving review after one year of use.. in between battery was draining very fastly.. but customer care helped and resolved quickly.. Tbh look is very cool but sharp edges are there.. packaging was very nice and safe also the delivery was on time... Thanks
822,1,I been using these product it's completely slow not worth of money you may regret after buying these product
823,1,"Slow working battery drain,"
824,5,Worth it
825,3,System is good but booting time it takes around 55 seconds and while updating windows system becomes very slow.
826,5,Requires SSD for better performance
827,5,it's so impressive and value for money... Overall it's showing great performance but u have to add ssd for better performance in gaming...
828,3,Poor performance
829,3,Frame drop happens when we play gta 5
830,4,With a ram and ssd....this is a true beastüî•
831,5,"The laptop is good the build quality is awesome and display,battery etc are excellent but you will get disappointed of the performance it takes around 5 minutes to boot it up and it lags even while using chrome with multiple tabs. Hope it will be better in the ssd version of the same laptop"
832,5,nice
833,3,"Well, the laptop could run GTA 5, with basic graphics. But, whenever I felt the game froze in the middle, I had to restart the laptop. The NFS Rivals car game ran very well, with minimal graphics. Crypto mining is not possible as the GPU only has 4 gb ram. Min you would need 6 gb for those kind of activities.  The boot time is a staggering 2 minutes 20 seconds and it's frustrating. The one I got was a replacement unit. Originally received one has defective display.  Waiting for the warranty..."
834,5,Good product
835,5,Nice
836,4,Nice product
837,3,The laptop is very slow
838,4,Good
839,3,Boot time is much high and processing is also slow
840,3,Average performance
841,1,Waste of money
842,5,It is so slow better to take ssd
843,5,We r really happy to purchased the HP pavilion by flipkart. Awesome product and awesome online shopping app i.e Flipkart.
844,3,Not so good!
845,4,Everything fine but harddisk little slower
846,2,Its too hanging
847,2,Not what was expected
848,3,Performance is low
849,4,The hinges are looking cool and give this laptop a cool look but in day to day usage they create problem. Screen is shaky cz of these hinges . Also there is no ssd i highly recommend if u are going to buy this laptop purchase a ssd soon. Overall laptop h fine. Gaming performance is great .
850,4,Good

852,4,Value for money product

854,3,Process is very slow
855,1,"Very poor laptop from HP. The design itself is faulty as the charging point location is bound to create problem due to its positioning on the laptop. Battery itself has been ok but it is difficult to get it charged. Display is ok but again due to design the screen panel vibrates even with the fan speed. With such impressive specifications the laptops takes too much of time to boot. This is for normal functions, i havent even used it for gaming purpose yet. Charger seems to be a cheap third gr..."
856,1,Very bad
857,5,Well good product
858,2,"Processor is very slower , I m not satisfied from this product, I want to change my laptop"
859,5,Best in this segment
860,5,"just upgrade it to 225 ssd, and then it will turn into beast.."
861,4,The laptop performance is not that good... because it requires to be upgraded.it is bang for the buck but without ram upgrade to 16gb and SSD you can't play any good AAA title game even at low settings...this issue is due to 2.1gb ram occupied by Vega 8 integrated graphics and paging issue due to HDD and low ram....go for it only if you can upgrade or go for another laptop...this is not a ready to play gaming laptop...
862,2,Very slow processar. Even after 8gb memory system hangs !
863,2,This product having lagging problem
864,4,Premium looking laptop . ‚ù§Ô∏è Value for money .‚ù§Ô∏è Don't think about it just go for it‚ù§Ô∏è
865,4,After 7 month booting time is so late But you can buying this laptop for more better experience.
866,5,Wonderfull
867,4,Good
868,1,The performance of a brand new unit was pathetic. The purple backlit sucks. The font on keyboard is not comfortable. Had to run a check with HP assistant. I dont recommend
869,2,Not suitable for gamers
870,5,With unique design and Backlit keyboard this looks fantastic..... But on the part of functioning it take a very long time to start... It seriously consumes much time to stable after restart too...
871,5,Awesome Gaming laptop
872,5,Lap is good But delivery is too late It's good working lap Nice design Overall good
873,5,Super laptop at this price segment.
874,3,"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming"
875,3,The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.
876,5,If you want a gaming laptop.You can definitely go with this laptop.But keep a thing in mind that it has a integrated graphic card which is AMD radeon vega 8 so it allocate approx 2GB of the RAM memory so you'll get only approx 5.9GB memory for RAM so heavy games like GTA V needs atleast 8GB of ram then it uses the virtual memory that is not much fast as RAM so you will feel some framedrops if you are a gamer so you have to upgrade the RAM.And also you can't deallocate the memory from the HP b...
877,5,Best laptop
878,4,"It's boot up slow, tools are 40 seconds due to HDD, otherwise it's OK."
879,5,"Don‚Äôt buy it if ur main aim is gaming.it has only 6gb usable ram and for gaming an additional 8gb ram is must.boot time is ok and can be made better with ann ssd.battery,sound and display r just wonderful.if ur going to college and want a gaming under budget I‚Äôd suggest u to go for it"
880,5,Great laptop for daily office use. On time delivery. Genuine product. Good packaging.
881,5,Worth of money
882,5,"Absolute beast keeping in mind the budget of the device.  I do not play games, rather I bought his for product and graphic design.  Adobe suite works flawlessly. 3 d modelling software works without any issues. Heating could be a issue while performing 3d rendering, suggest using a cooling pad to keep temp. In control.  On stock hdd ..boot time is more..suggest to upgrade to ssd and ram upgrade from hp service centre ..in order keep warranty intact."
883,5,Design super Sound quality super Display normal Battery usage super Totally value for money this product
884,5,The best.... Every penny was worth spending.

889,5,Thank you
890,4,Speed is slow but value of money for hp laptop and I suggest go with ssd varient
891,1,Speakers are not working !!
892,4,It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.
893,5,good look and performence
894,3,No SSD - makes loading new software very slow. Else good product.
895,1,I review this product when not added extra ram or ssd the performance may vary on adding them.Pls don't buy this product if you want üôè good performance it is not worth this price.pls go for intel i5 for this price range. I can't even open the task manager quickly when nothing is opened.pls hear my review. I felt very much for purchased this product. Many reviews says that it is a performance beast but i dont think it is a performance beast. I didn't take care of those negative reviews now i...
896,1,"They say it have 8gb RAM but 2.1 gb is hardware reserved So actual usable ram is 5.9gb only. I have use it for 3 months, lags during playing game even when using gpu. Battery life is not up to the mark. Overall its not worth the price."
897,4,good
898,5,Good product
899,5,best laptop
900,3,It is laptop with good spec but the one and only thing you have to do is to upgrade ur m2. Nmve ssd to have a good performance and bettee booting time. And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...

909,5,"Worth the money. SSD only gives 15-20 fps, without that itself its a beast, but some few lags in some point."
910,3,Nic laptop But it's booting time and performance is slow
911,5,"Using for 3 days now.... So far so good. In a budgeted gaming laptop, I guess it is one of the best you will acquire if you go for it."
912,5,Performance beast ... But needed a better battery capacity...
913,5,Nice but not that much
914,4,Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.

922,5,"What a powerful and sturdy laptop. Build quality is very impressive. I bought the 8gb version. Can upgrade to 16gb with another slot that supports 8gb ram. Ssd can also be installed. Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."
923,5,God
924,1,It was very slow by starting and slow performance. Simply don't waste u r money on this laptop.
925,4,Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.
926,5,excellent
927,4,Honest Review! This laptop is good for normal usage and light gaming purposes though it is very slow without an external SSD .So I would really recommend you to get a SSD and if possible upgrade the ram to 16 gb for flawless gaming.Sound quality is decent and video quality is sharp.
928,5,This is a budget gaming beast
929,1,Worst Laptop I ever purchased Don't Buy It Pls Waste of money It hangs too much
930,5,Complete value for money product Very much satisfactory performance
931,1,"Received already used and defect product ,applied for return but it's mentioned more than 15 days for replacement"
932,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."
933,2,The product wasn't expected..and also support not at all in time.
934,5,Very good....
935,4,"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc. So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent"
936,5,Best Product
937,1,It's the worst gaming laptop ever don't buy it.
938,4,Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money
939,1,This is the worst laptop that anyone can buy for gaming after a year the system us super slow... majority time there is a huge FPS drop while to play games.... it can not take heavy application into work time.... dont buy this Laptop u will be wasting ur money
940,2,Very poor quality performance...not worth it
941,4,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"
942,1,Please don't buy???
943,5,Good for normal editing and gamingüéÆ
944,4,Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible
945,4,Good
946,5,Love this product. My first laptop.
947,5,Honest Review  Just one thing  Add one more 8GB ram stick and bammm. U r good to go. Every single game runs at 60fps on high setting. Even RDR 2. Best laptop. Doesn't feel need of 4600h. This is enuf.
948,5,Great design with better performance
949,4,Everything is good but disappointed by flipkart delivery  I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm
950,1,Very slow laptop. Dont go on configurations...the new laptop OS is very very slow. Pathetic. With time it became more slow
951,5,"Very good laptop for gaming, runs gta 5, fifa 19 , COD and many games smoothly, for games like cyberpunk upgrade the RAM. Upgrade RAM and get an SSD and this is a BEAST."
952,4,Aavarage system running slow
953,5,If you are buying this product then buy a ram card and ssd with it it'll become beast after upgrading.
954,5,Very Well Featured Laptop
955,1,One of the worst experiences ever it's been almost over a year Very slow boot time Lag experience for gaming as well as general use It takes so much time just to open a folder
956,5,Sorry to say this The flipkart coustomer care are not responding properly when it need Am facing the issu with charger It's sparking wile charging cable connected to laptop. Am raised a request several time to Share my issue They are rising a request for call Also schedule time but not a call or massage recived from connesernd.

958,5,The delivery was fast and packing was good.
959,3,Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing
960,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
961,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
962,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
963,5,good
964,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."
965,4,Prosser is poor but value for money üí∞
966,1,"The windows 10 got corrupted, so i had to spend a ransome amount of money to install a new one, plus the sound system is not working, plus the camera wont open, totally disappointed."

968,5,"Very good laptop, but MS office is not pre-loaded"
969,5,Nice one for all
970,5,"Initially i was fed up with my selection, even after adding 8GB of RAM & 1TB SSD, But once i moved the OS to SSD this becomes beast, excellent performance and awesome speed, Still battery will be a problem, but you cannot expect more that this from this budget and configration,  Worth buying..!!!"
971,4,Really great product üî•

974,4,"Reviewing after 10 months Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet, No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube. I've also made some changes in amd control panel which boots performance. What I liked the most is it's cooling system. Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ..."
975,5,Worthy for Money
976,1,Lags a lot can‚Äôt even browse properly it can‚Äôt handle 10 pages in chrome at a time very disappointed
977,5,Good one.
978,3,"Games are getting lag in more scenarios. In 8 GB of RAM ,Only 5.88GB is usuable."
979,5,Amazing laptop ..... Just you need to update all driver's and perfomance will enhance 2x .... No heating issue... If you want super fast laptop just upgrade 250 GB SSD worth 3k
980,5,Superb
981,5,"Best laptop for mechanical design softwares , go for it"
982,2,The laptop is very slow. Not worthy
983,4,"The product is good.. But as highlighted by many other reviewers, laptop is slow because of HDD. Add an additional ssd for operating system and the laptop will work fine."
984,5,Phisically it looks much better than pic awesome mid weight laptop
985,5,Nice laptop
986,5,This laptop is best in this budget and also this lags a lot but we can fix it by upgrading SSD
987,5,Super working
988,4,"Overall a value for money product...does not gets heat,good design and build overall"
989,3,Booting up and opening an app is very slow
990,5,"Good laptop at this price range. It does not hv a professional look though, build quality is good. Battery back up is ok."
991,5,Nice laptop. Performance is very good. But only problem is the loading speed. I know it ls slow because of hdd. But it's slower than average laptop boot. For the 1st boot it took around 25 mins. Then 2nd boot took around 2 minutes. Then it takes 20 to 25 seconds for booting. Screen is quite good and design is too awesome. It looks amazing. Other reviews says its battery backup is not good. But u need to know that battery is too good. I get around 6 hrs backup with 70% brightness and backlit k...
992,5,This laptop is gaming but you have do firstly upgrade it by ssd And it's battry backup is 2.5 hours at normal use it will be become less at time of gaming

994,4,Its work very slow.
995,4,Nice
996,5,Good but more laggy and display ausome everything ausome but it laggs more
997,5,Product is very good. But when I opened for the first time it took almost a hour to open. But overall it's best value for money product.
998,4,A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it I am totally satisfied with the laptop. I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software
999,5,"Best product Supeb , exllentwork,very fast"
1000,4,"Such a nice laptop in this price range! But I'm feeling little bit slow, while booting up pc and while updating windows os! But otherwise it's super cool and working like a monster. No lag in games! Mainly I purchased this laptop for my development works!"

1013,4,"The product was well packaged. However to optimize this gaming Laptop to its full potential, to play games require more than 4Gb of RAM you need to add another 8Gb of ddr4 ram. For faster performance also add at least 240Gb SSD. Slots to add RAM and SSD is available."

1090,1,HDD is damn slow.. after a month the system is not booting up. Please don't purchase this laptop
1091,1,Poor quality camera... slow performance... Not at all value for money.. Requested for replacement... Lets see..
1092,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
1093,3,Okay okay not very good the thing is the likes are great and the battery is also good the only thing which is a problem is its speed its slow and yes I dont mean slowing or a bit slow it's very slow
1094,4,Good prodect
1095,5,It is so nice.... I love this laptop.. It is running very smoothly... For programmers it is the best laptop.... It is also good for light gaming no lack issues show in this laptop.... Nice product... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1096,2,Laptop is very slow and it stucked
1097,2,Battery backup is low . Performance is poor.
1098,5,Throw in a nvme m.2 and you are good to go. Either purchase the modal with ssd or install one. Otherwise don't buy it.
1099,5,It's a cool laptop it is especially good for online classes and gaming üëå if you are a student or want to become a gaming YouTube then you should buy this it's pretty cool üòé
1100,1,Don't buy it for higher level works Not good product very slow
1101,5,Best lp Very fast processor.

1109,2,i am use 2 week but laptop is very slowly open not fast open time 18 second my second pc 6 second open

1111,5,"Loved it, awesome product. üíñ"
1112,4,Very good laptop for desent gaming
1113,5,Nyc laptop It's working smoothly Design is also good
1114,5,My keyboard was faulty
1115,5,Gerat at this price range.but you have to upgrade it to enjoy this beastüî•üî•üî•
1116,3,Heating and lag issue...
1117,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
1118,4,Nice good laptop
1119,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
1120,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
1121,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
1122,5,It's the beast go for it
1123,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
1124,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
1125,5,beast laptop at this price
1126,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
1127,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
1128,5,good
1129,1,Its not working properly
1130,5,Great after 1 week of use
1131,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
1132,5,Good products
1133,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
1134,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
1135,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
1136,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
1137,5,Very good product value for money
1138,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
1139,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
1140,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
1141,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
1142,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
1143,1,Dnt buy very slow while using cad software
1144,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
1145,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
1146,5,Good Product
1147,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
1148,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
1149,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
1150,3,I can play free fire with lag
1151,5,Awesome product
1152,1,Waste of money
1153,4,"When I bought this loptop earlier I thought why it performs very slow like opening applications, loading, taking more time to boot up later, I realised and I added SSD to this after that it will performing like a beast and now it is booting in 15 seconds. I am playing forntine, Apex legends, Minecraft, valorant etc., I didn't get any issues like lagging while playing the games even in 8 gb ram. In future I will upgrade ram to 16 gb but now this was enough to me. Coming to laptop Display quali..."

1160,5,All rights but boot is very slow
1161,5,It was really a nice product
1162,2,Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not
1163,1,Booting time is to long very slow performance and not worth it
1164,3,Not satisfied with the performance speed...
1165,5,Very nice product . Delivery before time . Satisfying ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
1166,4,Entry level laptop
1167,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
1168,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
1169,5,Good performance...
1170,5,It is best under prize range
1171,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
1172,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."
1173,1,Charging port loose connection & very slow performance Not satisfied.

1181,3,Dont expect too much
1182,3,While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.
1183,4,Superb quality
1184,4,Gud product and value for money
1185,3,If thay have added even a 128Gb SSD means it's an amazing deal..
1186,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
1187,4,"Laptop is good for mid-level gaming and official purpose. Design is classy, suitable for both gaming and office.  Recommended: upgrade to 500gb ssd and 8gb ddr4 ram for ultra performance."

1357,3,Cyberpunk lagging even after running on low settings Assassin's creed black flag runs at high settings Laptop automatically shut down while playing game at high setting(after 15 mins) Only problem with ram. As 6 gb is usable. Need to upgrade.
1358,5,Good but sometime works slow
1359,1,Very slow. Startup takes 15 mins.
1360,5,"If you are going to buy this order a 8gb 2400mhz ram with it else the ram will bottleneck the GTX 1650 and u may think that the laptop is not efficient, cuz of integrated graphics only 5.88gb of ram available  a perfect classic gamming laptop , u can use this for both professional use and gamming .it doesn't look aggressive as other gamming laptop . Great performance , with hdd it just takes 20 or 19sec to boot up initially Display - is superb it has led display Sound - loud and clear Batter..."
1361,5,Good
1362,5,Product is good.. Satisfied
1363,2,5.58 gb ram only usable pls avoid to buy this laptop Its booting time is not fast it take too much time Design was awsome.but its has only design...
1364,4,Everything seems to be perfect except at this price range we deserve ssd and slightly better build quality . Overall nice experience.
1365,5,This laptop is very good but if u need gaming faster then you need to attach a ssd around 140GB or 240Gb.
1366,4,All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD
1367,5,Super good
1368,4,Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.
1369,4,Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.
1370,3,Battery not good...only works 3 hrs
1371,4,At this price its worth buying without a second thought.
1372,4,Good
1373,3,Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute
1374,5,Best Product Truly
1375,4,"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price"
1376,3,Don't buy ryzen take intel
1377,5,Just amazing
1378,5,The best
1379,4,"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck."
1380,4,Nice
1381,3,Battery backup is very worst
1382,3,"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also."
1383,5,"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go"
1384,5,In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•
1385,5,The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good
1386,5,Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.
1387,4,If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .
1388,5,Very nice products
1389,1,"I had an issue as there was a stuck pixel on my laptop and even though it's a manufacturing defect, hp does not want to help me. I'm also under warranty."
1390,5,Only upgrade to ssd and it will be a rocket
1391,4,Great gaming laptop in this price range. You can easily play most modern games on High settings and get around 45-60 fps.  One thing that they don't tell you us that 2gb RAM is reserved for the integrated graphics so you only have around 5.9 gb RAM available which can cause issues with latest games. So I would suggest getting an extra 8gb RAM if you want to smoothly play all the latest titles.
1392,4,It is a great budget buy as it has capacity to upgrade Like extra ram slot (which you require soon as ryzen blocks 2 gb by default) and m0.2 slot for SSD so ample opportunity to upgrade value for money
1393,5,Excellent product
1394,2,Microsoft office home & Student not installed in this laptop.Buy seperately cost 8000 Rs.
1395,4,Great
1396,1,Vesy slow performance unexpected from HP
1397,5,Go for it if you want a good laptop for gaming and video editing
1398,3,Lagging not satisfied with the product
1399,3,This laptop hangs. Like seriously after this much of processors and RAMs. Should have gone for SSD one thats beast.
1400,1,It claims 8gb ram but only 6gb is usable. The processor gets very slow eventually.. Not good for gaming
1401,1,Third class laptop no refund
1402,5,Good machine in this prise segment I suggest only this device
1403,5,ALL ARE GOOD. - Only things what I am Missing... Is SSD - Awesome laptop with very good performance - Got this @46 in Diwali Sale..
1404,5,Great performance and looking too good
1405,5,"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you..."
1406,1,Very slow working
1407,2,Brand new laptop with 8GB RAM and Genuine Window 10 pre installed. But there is problem of hang from beginning.
1408,4,been using it for a week now. its a mean machine. performance and looks are great. üëçüèº.
1409,5,Good value of money
1410,4,"I had planned to buy a Lenovo ideapad for 45k i3 10th gen....but later on I found this laptop ..I am not into gaming but a 8k extra it got me a rayzen 5...15.6 display IPS panel,B&O sound ,nividia graphics 4gb ,illuminated keyboard ,tough build ,excellent cooling since it's gaming laptop ,8gb 1tb HDD...It's build is excellent ...I think it's a excellent purchase for 53k with HDFC discount...only thing I found is a SSD would have been to avoid a bit lag ..but the best thing is both ram and SSD..."
1411,5,Except battery all are good in this price range... U can buy it
1412,3,Overall Nice but it will hang when you will run multiple software and chrome
1413,2,After 2months use... Trust me guys the system is too slow and my old pc with 2 gb ram was faster... Tried calling the customer support many times and no resolution the laptop is still slow. Normal things take time like even if I want to open browser or my computer it srsly takes atleast 45-50secs which is slow for a 8gb ram laptop and imagine playing games or using heavy softwares. Battery hardly holds for 2hrs drains like anything and even when I fully charge the laptop and it's turned off ...
1414,4,Best laptop for new user Everything is good Camera 4/5 Battery 4.5/5 Performance 4.5/5 Display 5/5 Gaming 4.5/5
1415,2,"i am giving this review by using this laptop by 4 months only . it take 10 to 15 mini to start the , very slow... performance is display is good , average product..."
1416,5,Too good lapi.. I love it
1417,4,Good in all ways...but takes time in booting...Battery life too short..
1418,5,Got what I Want.
1419,5,"Awesome üëç loved it. Good performance. I use it for editing purposes , it's awesome , no lag or hang , working properly."
1420,4,Very good product. Delivery was very fast
1421,1,Its a average laptop to buy at this price point. Everything is average except for the ram it uses. I don't know why but out of the 8gbram is only 5gb is useable. This seriously slows down the laptop. Can't change the settings through bios because it is locked by HP  Do check the physical condition of the laptop. The first one i got had a problem with the F6 key.it came out of the keyboard.
1422,1,Received defective product. Flipkart replaced it. After replacing again received defective product. Didn't expect this from flipkart or hp. Worst experience ever.
1423,3,Laptop isn't that great until it has an ssd in it because without ssd it's just frustrating to use this lap Otherwise for gaming it's a beast and for multitasking too Go for this one if u have a budget below 50k
1424,5,"On battery the display is good.. otherwise without battery the light is low. Gaming is smooth with 12Gb ram and 16Gb ram for COD warzone, GTA V, Assassin creed series including Odyssey, Apex Legends, Horizon zero dawn etc"
1425,1,Worst... product....super slow...don't waste money
1426,5,Very nice model with good performance
1427,4,"Such an awesome laptop ,beast in performance"
1428,2,"The laptop is very slow..Taking too much time to open any app. Also take approx 4-5 sec to refresh..my 14 yrs old pc having ram 2 gb , dual core processor is much faster than this laptop.. .Infact i didnt get refund option..Flipkart did fraud with me."
1429,4,Ok
1430,5,It's pretty decent laptop. The only problem is it doesn't support hardware virtualization. It means you won't be able to use virtual box or VMware. Just think before you purchase
1431,1,"On Flipkart page it was written 0% intrest EMI from Kotak Bank. But both cheated as Bank started charging intrest. And on complaining to both, no solution was done. They just tossed the ball in other party's area to resolve the problem. Atlast I made prepayment of that emi to save the intrest amount"
1432,5,Excellent
1433,5,Nice
1434,5,Superb laptop
1435,3,Not too much satisfied from the performance. But yeah this is the good laptop for mid range gaming and office users.
1436,5,Good

1438,5,Best laptop in this range . Body is made of hard plastic . Both ram and storage are upgradable
1439,3,Good
1440,3,Buy asus better then this
1441,3,Upgrade to ssd. Boot up is pretty slow as well as opening softwares. But a RAM too if you want a lili but of additional performance
1442,4,Battery backup is not so good but all other features are just amazing üî•
1443,4,"If you upgrade it with an extra 8gb ram supported with SSD, then there shouldn't be any complaint about its performance. Yes, sometimes the mouse cursor gets stuck somewhere, but that is only for a second and not frequently. It handles most of the new generation or AAA games pretty much efficiently. Overall, I'm really satisfied. But you need to upgrade it with SSD and another 8gb of ram."
1444,3,"Gud laptop in this price range! Gave 3star becouse HD version is so slow, go for an SSD version or add an SSD to it."
1445,2,"Not very satisfying performance, I got a damaged products for the first time and the replacement process in one word ""Degaster"". Finally after more then 50 call I got the replacement after 18 days. So simply avoid the product."
1446,4,Not gud for this price better to go with ssd
1447,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."
1448,5,"Highly recommended, the packing was fantastic, macbook feels very rich no doubt and it has its own fluidity, i m having a gr8 experience with this beauty after switching from a windows pc. Awesome product love u mac."
1449,5,"I wanted to buy a laptoo fir mild use which will serve me smoothly for atleast 4-5 years.. im a student and my parents use it just to browse , listen to music , facetime and all those basic things.. i dont about the technical aspects so I'll give a review thats more on the informal side.... The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone ..."
1450,4,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
1451,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1452,4,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
1453,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.  I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks..."

This is a really fabulous product, Its not about latest model or old model, I believe you need to select product based on your profession and requirements I am an IT programmer and this product fulfils my all requirements.

1455,3,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1456,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1457,1,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
1458,4,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...
1459,5,"Its a beast that u can't judge without using it. I don't know what have Apple done to this laptop (you can refer it as Black Magic), Best in class performance, no other laptop can beat its speed in this price range and nearer high range laptops.

I bought this in big billion day offer for a cheapest price. This MacBook Air apart from everyone's negative view is a great laptop. If you are a gamer go for something else. This looks so good."
1462,1,quite frankly not worth in case you are looking to purchase a business laptop. just wasted my money on this product.  some negatives are mentioned below  1. in case you are extensive user of Excel sheets then this laptop is not for you. As majority of the functions in Excel won't work on this product. I have been told by the apple support to install Windows OS üòÇ instead if I have that kind of work  2. in case you are a gamer don't purchase this product. Processing is not optemized to ensure ...
1463,4,Nice product awsome look and performance as i expected to be But my charger is heating up‚ô®‚ô® very fast As too much that i can't hold it
1464,5,What can I say about this awesome product . Bought this laptop for android dev. Working like pro smoothly running all programs But having some heating issue sometimes feel cpu heating.
1465,5,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it. Anyways got it for 51k in Diwali offer. But even for 62k it is bett...

It's quite better then windows laptop of this price range speed and processing is fast but display colours are not vibrant but its not that bad too its good for normal works.

Well an apple it is. So doesn't need any introduction. I have been a window users since the very beginning so a pleasant change for me."
1473,5,"I bought this in 2018 January for a whooping 44500/- deal. Apple doesn't compromise on their quality on any of their products and specially on their Mac products. Now coming to this Macbook Air A1466, this product is outdated with it's features and you don't get any authentic supplies like screen, Dock or landing zones, etc. from a third party vendor.

I bought it at 52k. I have ipad pro 9.7. If you want to buy it. Go for it. Save 50k for Ipad pro. This ipad will work as extra monitor for you as well as tablet too. Editing in final cut pro is good but not tried much and..."
1475,5,"I used to make fun of Apple products being over priced and not worth the buy. I'd like to correct it, it is over priced but your spent on it is worth.

1476,5,Stylish elegant and attractive.  Owsome laptop by Apple and good to use battery life and laptop performance is owsome.  Most owsome part is his trackpad the way Apple think and design the laptop trackpad is owsome.  You can not find it any other laptop.

1482,3,"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly)."

1496,5,"What can I say?? Its a beautiful piece just built amazingly. Love the track pad which is so soft and even though the screen is small and old, its worth every penny. Just buy it."
1497,3,"First time Mac users please read this. Best at this Price Point, even if it is increased from 55000 to 65000 within an year but still good. Yes when you are setting up your Mac please press on the trackpad because if you just click then it will not work you can change that to touch after setting up your Mac after going to settings. I use this Mac for all of my work like UI & UX Designing, 2D & 3D Animation, 3D modeling in blender, Video Editing etc. And it works great. You will find a bit he..."
1498,1,"I was really excited to work on MacBook Air . The desig. js flawless ; it's lightweight , slim, gives a premium look , the touchpad design is also very simple , elegant and sophisticated . the issue which is troubling me now is the heating issue and the battery backup. There is a considerable heating issue in this laptop . Also the battery backup is really bad. So if you're to work for long hours , you'll always have to carry your charger along with you . Else the design and performance is ..."
1499,5,"I was confused between this and MacBook pro. If you ain‚Äôt going to use it as a professional 4k video/photo editor or a hard core gamer go for MacBook Pro.  If you does light editing ( 1080p or less) for your YouTube channel and normal photoshop editing your photos, this machine works perfectly fine. Go for it without any doubt.  Pros: - Very Light weight - Great Performance - Cheapest Macbook available - SSD drive - Has MacOS (Virus free OS) - Great Apple ecosystem if you use iPhone and..."

1502,5,"I bought this one for stability. This one is sleek, like super sleek and sexy. Although I miss the numeric keyboard but the stability, battery and performance makes up for it. And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t..."

1508,1,"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs. Apple always integrates software and hardware better than other company in the world.  Con: the operating system needs some time to get adjusted to. But once you learn it - you will be enjoying a fantastic experience."
1509,1,"apple macbook air mid 2017 is well known compact business machine. It weighs around 1.65 kg. It comes with Sierra mac os, upgradable with Mojave mac os.

1513,1,"Before buying Macbook, first anaylse your requiremnets. If you want a descent laptop with highest battery backup and which can be easily portable and you don't want it for gaming purpose. Then I must recommend you for the Macbook Air. The 2017 model which I have purchased performs well even when many apps are simultaneously open. Also if you are switching from windows to mac, then you will see the vast differences and you will love it. In short its a perfect laptop for general task such as do..."
1514,2,"first time Mac user, performance wise far better than my old window laptop,look should be improved wrt the bezel rest are good. battery backup mentioned around 12 hour but it's around 8 hour with normal usage which is fine I guess. good for people who want to use premium laptop within reasonable budget."

1520,1,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.

1522,1,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"

1525,1,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
1526,1,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
1527,1,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
1528,1,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
1529,2,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
1530,1,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
1531,1,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
1532,1,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !
1533,5,"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup."
1534,2,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
1535,1,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
1536,1,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
1537,4,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
1538,5,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"
1539,5,"Hello,  Here is my Review after 10 days of purchase  Pro : 1.Smoothness 2.Superb battery backup 3. No hang, no lagging 4. After sell support from apple just wow 5. smooth for photoshop  Cons: 1. Charger problem, Overheated (May be in my case Only) 2. For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
1540,4,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1. Four Google Chrome Tabs 2. Three excel sheets 3. Two Word documents. 4. Microsoft Teams 5. Netflix 6. Youtube  I have not been able to find any performance issues so far. The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...
1541,3,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
1542,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"
1543,5,"Good product for software developer .when i used this laptop for web development and software development like python and its library its quite good for that.it also good for simple deep learning model creations and data science project . storage is less . its fast compare to windows i5, its smooth compare to windows any machines . but when i used this laptop for virtual machine it is not quite good for that bcz of less storage and i5 processor .when u used this laptop for virtual machine bat..."

1545,2,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).  Cons: If you are planning to play games....this is not for you, this is a..."
1546,1,"- using for coding and Xcode work well in this - space is little less , we take back in 2 months - design is great - 2017 model we get and registered into apple support website - great for browsing - for photoshop designing not so good"
1547,1,"If you are looking at a laptop with good performance and good battery life and want to do programming this laptop is for you. There are some pros and cons in this laptop.  Pros : 1. The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3. Battery life is good it gives 6-8 hours of battery backup 4. Keypad is very lite and doesn't make soun..."
1548,4,"awesomeness is the word. awesome speed, awesome battery, awesome multi tasking, awesome (light) weight, awesome touch pad (no use of mouse reqd)"
1549,4,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
1550,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1551,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
1552,1,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
1553,1,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
1554,2,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
1555,1,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1556,1,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
1557,1,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
1558,3,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1559,1,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1560,1,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1561,1,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind.

Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1568,1,it's just a nice product
1569,1,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.

1574,1,It's is quite good n really amazing at 45k budget I love this product but delivery is very late. Battery backup is super very slim n well design n compacted
1575,1,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1576,3,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1577,1,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
1578,1,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

Cons: 1) Battery last only 10 hours on heavy usag..."
1588,1,The product received was well packed and safe. The best part was it was Sept 2019 imported so not that old piece. I basically am not a very heavy user of laptops. Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
1589,1,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
1590,3,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

1592,5,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.

1612,3,"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products. Being able to unlock my laptop using my watch is great. It‚Äôs pricy, but I guess you're also paying for the brand When you think of Apple you automatically think expensive if your anything like me. When purchasing this lap..."

Nevertheless good job with the delivery flipkart. Appreciate"

1638,4,"simply. the best laptop. using it for general purpose as well as python programming. has been a delight so far with quick battery charge. ease of use ,sleek looks and amazing performance"
1639,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1640,2,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"
1641,1,Best for Travel.....very Handy and stylish.... best battery life .... last nearly for 10 to 12 hrs for normal use....
1642,1,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1643,1,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."
1644,5,I Love Apple Products it is perfect match for my old I phone 5s and redmi note 4 this is awesome slick laptop and very beautiful

1649,4,"absolutely awesome and ideal laptop for any college student ( except civil , mechanical engineer and architect as you guys should go for MacBook Pro as you will require extreme computing power for your designing projects) due to the fact that despite being bit underpowered on paper the permonance is as good as any windows laptop of 16 gb RAM and 8th generation i5 processor. Unless you are a hardcore gamer and can not afford the price, DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER LAPTOP other than MacBook Air if you ..."

Android studio and xcode runs smoothly without lag. Even emulator of Android studio runs very smoothly. 5. Mag safe port is really good thing.  cons:- 1. Its i5 5th gen which is very old. 2. Display is small but that cannot be considered as cons.  if all pros are there then why just 3 üåü? Because I feel my device is defe...
1655,1,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product. But hey, Apple is really good at giving you a Year of Warranty despite you buy it through an Apple Retailer/Reseller or through an online Reseller like Flipkart does. Though the latter one give..."

1666,1,"This is the best budget Apple laptop one can get. Pretty light weight and great for everyday use. I have another pro - so 128 GB was good enough in my case. However, I would suggest 256 GB to be at a comfortable spot. Performs just great and battery life is excellent."

Well aluminium built body but very light to carry anywhere. Performance is excellent. Battery backup is also very gud . With my first charge I used it for a week. Very satisfied with the product. Apple product standards are unmatched in the market.
1669,5,"Very Efficient Device. Apple devices have strong integration between hardware and software hence even with lower specs on paper, it outperform windows running hardware. This Mac is good enough for daily activity, running programming IDE, emulators etc. Not meant for heavy duty gaming, but 8gb of RAM can handle moderate gaming as well. Most Amazing feature is battery life, unparalleled even when compared to macbook pro. I get 10+ hrs on moderate usage on single charge. Was a steal at 45k, a we..."

1674,1,Happy with the product & packing was good .  if ur looking for a Sleek and portable laptop with efficient battery then this one is a good pick. Display though is a bit on the lower side unlike the Apple retina display.  Also consider that the laptop doesnt have any lan port or hdmi port.we need to separately purchase the thunderbolt2 converters.The actual apple prices are proced above 1500 bucks.   Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.

1711,1,Excellent Storage is not sufficient
1712,1,The machine is simply amazing compared to any other machine. The OS is clean and fast. The display is also good. The keyboard and track pad are smooth as honey.  Had a few mild scratches its kind of ignorable.  Thank you Flipkart and Apple.
1713,1,Really loving the experience...Just loving itüëç
1714,1,"Fast boot time , excellent display, no slowness, definitely good."
1715,2,"It gives me nearly 7 hrs of battery life when I stream on YouTube, Viki etc. Even though it's only dual core yet I have never faced any kind of lag. Best thing is, if you want to do video editing it comes preloaded with iMovie, which in my opinion gets the job done for most of the people who edit videos."
1716,3,Thanks flipcart I am very satisfied with this product
1717,4,The 4* is because the magsafe (the adapter) is getting heated while charging...

1723,1,Flipkart delivery was frustrating. Ordered on 25th Oct and received on 3rd Nov. But wait was worth. Shifting from Windows to Mac was a big decision. And all I can say that Mac is super fun. Go for it.

1729,4,"Worth every bit. If you're looking for a laptop that is fast - avoid Windows it can't multitask. MacBook hardly takes a second to start up. Can multitask without hanging and is sleek, light and has a longer battery life than my previous Windows laptop. It's been 2 months I'm using this and it is as smooth as butter."

1749,1,"Hello there!!! This product really rocks. I don't have to write much about apple products which is known wide already but as a first time MAC user I am very much impressed. To be frank I was worried upon the negative review of this lap top where people have mentioned about heck a lot of complaints on the product build quality and performance. But after using my received item, I feel much satisfied not the laptop. It is just like handling a mobile but in the form of a lap top and very addicti..."
1750,5,Perfectly designed for business travelling people.
1751,5,if you are really serious about display quality then it is quite disappointed for me when i first open and expected a good display .. if you have budget go for retina display
1752,1,Excellent.

1754,1,Genuine product love it
1755,1,"If you love the iOS environment, want superb connectivity with your iPhone, this laptop is the best deal out there. Of course if you have the bucks, the other mac models are awesome too. The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."
1756,1,Good product with this price 56k
1757,1,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
1758,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...
1759,4,"Worth the penny... I was afraid about the online purchase, but Flipkart didn't made me down. It was all perfect and the MacBook Air- an awesome product by Apple. I love it"
1760,1,Worth the offer!
1761,1,Good.
1762,5,Nice product
1763,3,Awesome product ...great...
1764,4,"At 45k pricepoint its the best. Lightweight as name suggests. Ssd quickly opens everything Short on storage (purchase an external hard disk or jetdrive or something like it) Battery backup the best off all laptops, more than 12hrs of backup working on docs and listening songs. Magsafe charges even quickly. Less ports so separate adapters are must Overall bestbuy at this pricepoint"

The product arrived to Kochi within 24 hrs of placing the order however it got delivered on the third day of reaching the city. It would have been just WOW if delivery was within 24 hrs of reaching the city.  The packing was very good and its import date is of Aug 2017. The os got upgraded to high sierra on updation.  The exchange o...
1768,4,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac. But believe me it's not that difficult. I had few issues in the beginning but you can always Google it and find the solution. Also Flipkart did the good job of delivering it as per promised.

Thanks Retail net and Flipkart"

I hope it will not disappoint you if you are thinking buying it. kindly do check about latest model as well. This is 2017 model though you can go with this as it has all the regular updates which Apple provides.
1786,5,It is as amazing as a laptop can be. Buy it for daily use and work purpose. Gaming is not possible. Battery life is phenomenal. Works like a charm and is a 2017 edition. Great buy. Received on time and with great exchange offer.

1789,5,A great product from Apple. I bought it just to give it a try to Mac and now I am never going back to windows ever. Soon I will need a pro version though. The specifications are on a lower side but the experience is so good. Worth every penny.  received a cashback of 10500. Great deal

1806,1,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
1807,5,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.
1808,2,"Thanks Flipkart, Good time delivery. Another apple brand so classic ,so elegant and beautiful. all rumours with this are just wastefull. awesome build quality, look , screen ,work absolutely flowless.  switching myself from window to macbook. Great product by apple at such price. five star."
1809,5,"A very nice laptop but is overpriced.The maintenance is too damn high.I bough this in 2018 and in 2 years this laptop broke down two times,both during june july month.The service centre told it's a common problem with macbook air.The first time it crashed it was still in warranty period and hence was repaired for free. But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y..."
1810,1,"Macbook air as a product is undoubtedly great. however a word of caution regarding the seller. Not a reliable seller. i bought it from Truecom retail and was sold by sane retails pvt ltd from telangana. when i checked the serial number of the macbook for warranty status on apple website, it showed purchase date not validated and serial number was not mentioned in the invoice. hence it was not showing 1 yr warranty. I contacted flipkart for resolving the issue and i was promised that issue wou..."

1828,1,"light , fast and easy to handle, good purchase"
1829,5,"No comparison with any other laptop for any task. Best machine for coding, graphic designing and business use. But, If you need a laptop for professional video editing and can spend some more money, Go for Macbook PRO..! Otherwise MacBook Air is best laptop and value for money"
1830,5,Very good
1831,1,"I am a software developer, It works fine for me."
1832,4,Suffering to adapt the iOS system while whole life spent using windows.

1834,5,"Its Mac so no need to tell anything about the product. But I must tell about Flipkart. delivery was fast, nicely packed. after two months all of a sudden my mac charger stop working, may be my bad luck. I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
1835,3,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...
1836,4,"First of all thanks to flipkart for big billion day and quick delivery. Got the product for 43500/-, one of the best deal.  No doubt that machine performs well. No heating issues and quite easy to carry around. Good battery backup as well. If may feel a bit of difficulty in using the machine initially is you are from a windows world. But it just takes few hours to familiarize and then you will enjoy the ride"
1837,1,This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...
1838,5,Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free. Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.

Ppl who travel and are looking for great combination of speed and battery backup have only one option that is MacBook Air"

1859,5,Laptop is really good. I've bought it 2.5 years ago and working fine for first year and then suddenly I was unable to start my Mac. Display was not working but my good luck that it was still in warrenty and thus they have replaced motherboard and it started working again and after exactly one year I'm facing same issue but this time they told me that I need to replace the motherboard which coast me 42000.  I suggest not to buy this laptop.
1860,1,"I've purchased this laptop for 45k during big billion day sale and I was lucky to get it at that unbelievable price. Talking about the laptop, in 2018 it is outdated with the hardware and the design but still, it is the best buy if you got this 3 major aspects before going for a laptop : 1) Long battery life 2) Light Weight 3) Versatile Then go for it without thinking about anything else. Yeah, it is not for the gamers. I use it regularly for coding, web and movies and it is doing pretty awes..."

After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients.

But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."
1892,1,been using it since 12-Aug and seems to be perfectly good Apple MacBook Air...seems to be a good investment

1899,5,I am posting this 1 star not for the laptop but for Flipkart..They keep exchange offer and expect that customers will give them a brand new product in return.The pick up guy comes and cancels for scratches
1900,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
1901,3,Cool üòéüòé nice product
1902,4,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
1903,2,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
1904,3,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
1905,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
1906,3,It work slow
1907,5,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
1908,1,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
1909,2,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
1910,4,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
1911,3,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
1912,1,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
1913,1,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
1914,5,"Good service , good product, Happy with Purchase..."
1915,2,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
1916,4,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."
1917,4,I am using it for 3 years. So far the best experience with Apple.
1918,5,I agrer that not all with believe... but after one year you will face issue while turning the PC ON...U go to Apple Store and you willl find 5-6 persons around u complaining samr thing.. Better have another option

1925,5,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"

1927,4,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
1928,5,so good
1929,3,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
1930,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class

1961,4,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

1970,2,Highly recommended for College Students.
1971,3,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."
1972,1,"I purchased this on oct 2018. From that time I got 3 times issue. Now it is out of warranty and costing of repairing is 49,000/-. I am not happy with the product. Really very disappointed."
1973,3,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future

1983,3,"don't buy MacBook online, keyboard not working ,not repairable only replaceable"
1984,5,"I was a bit confused about this laptop as it is my first laptop. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops with higher specifications in this price range, but I'm a CSE student so i don't need any heavy laptop at all i wanted one which could last atleast 4 years and have decent battery life.

2084,1,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
2085,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

2111,1,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
2112,1,Awesome
2113,3,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
2114,1,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!
2115,4,sexy and hot
2116,4,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
2117,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
2118,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."
2119,1,macbook doesn't need reviews because its the best.
2120,1,SUPERB

2154,1,thankyou flipkart for such great deal.
2155,5,Really I like this product. Nice battery backup and totally different from windows.
2156,5,"No words to describe, loved the product."
2157,4,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
2158,4,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
2159,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."
2160,3,"Works flawlessly, I mainly use it for software development üëç"

2162,4,awsm..........
2163,5,Simply Awesome
2164,4,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
2165,5,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.
2166,2,Excellent packing by Flipkart.Product is so so good.I love it

2172,3,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
2173,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
2174,1,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
2175,5,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!
2176,1,"Got it for 43k from sale. And It has all , what you expect from a macbook."
2177,4,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."

2183,4,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
2184,3,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
2185,1,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
2186,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
2187,1,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.
2188,3,This is the newer version with latest 2017 Sierra OS. It comes with 8GB ram. 10 hours battery life on full charge. full aluminum body.  Go for it.
2189,4,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
2190,5,Impressive!!!
2191,5,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
2192,3,Who else got it for 38K :D
2193,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
2194,1,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
2195,1,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
2196,2,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
2197,1,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
2198,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
2199,1,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
2200,2,nice product.fast deliver....love it
2201,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
2202,5,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
2203,2,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
2204,5,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
2205,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
2206,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
2207,2,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
2208,5,nice prodect
2209,5,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
2210,2,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
2211,5,Good product but price varies
2212,3,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
2213,1,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
2214,5,Great
2215,5,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
2216,4,Amazing quality
2217,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
2218,1,Very nice products.
2219,5,Good but price high
2220,4,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
2221,5,Perfect
2222,2,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
2223,3,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
2224,1,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
2225,3,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
2226,1,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
2227,4,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
2228,2,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
2229,3,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
2230,4,charget not found
2231,1,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
2232,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
2233,1,I think window is better system Crashes
2234,1,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
2235,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
2236,5,Superb product
2237,1,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
2238,1,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
2239,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
2240,5,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
2241,3,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
2242,4,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
2243,4,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
2244,5,Stunningly superb
2245,5,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
2246,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
2247,3,bettery performance not upto the mark
2248,1,It's a good product but not value for money
2249,4,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
2250,4,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
2251,5,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
2252,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
2253,3,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
2254,1,not good quality
2255,3,awesome product saves lot of time
2256,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
2257,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
2258,1,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

2265,1,Only a show off product
2266,1,Best laptop in 48k...
2267,5,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

2292,2,Best MacBook air in price and battery quality is very good
2293,4,"Never trust flipkart for these products. After 5 months of the purchase my laptop's motherboard is damaged without any reason at all. The charge doesn't stay even for 5 hours. I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

2297,5,Awesome product Really superior Mac Book in all branded laptop
2298,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

2311,4,Pros: Smooth / Blazing fast performance Battery backup is 6-7 hours Regular OS updates iCloud sync /Apple ecosystem Well built apps  Cons: Low resolution Fragile Required additional accessories for memory/LAN/VGA/HDMI etc Price
2312,4,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

2342,5,Just Amazing
2343,4,Good
2344,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
2345,3,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
2346,5,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
2347,3,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.
2348,5,Hard to get familiarised first. Memory space is an issue. Overall good experience
2349,4,Nice Product
2350,4,Good üòå

2413,1,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

2486,3,Awesome laptop in amazing price
2487,5,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
2488,3,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."
2489,4,Good timely delivery by Flipkart
2490,3,"Always wanted to buy a MacBook. Purchased for 59k.  Although the model runs down to 2017, still worth every penny in 2020.  Comes updated with latest Mac OS Catalina 10.15."

Display very bad with HD resolution. UI very bad to Me l, Windows 10 is best. Latest OS Catalina pre-installed. Usable SSD above 80GB. 8GB DDR3 Ram. Intel core i5 5th gen with intel graphics.

2511,5,After using for more than 6 months I can say the product is good. Good for normal uses and weather home or office. In this price the product is good..but if some one looking for best Processor more than i5 Or long video edits or longer time cpu usage may this will not meet you requirements.
2512,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app). Literally, I am getting 12 hours of battery. There is no issue of heating...."
2513,3,"The best apple product for a student, affordable. Being a commerce student (MBA) it's very easy to install & use MS office. People say it's difficult to run MS Office, it's myth. Believe me it works much better than a windows laptop. Overall product quality is best, very light weight and easy use, battery is very very good, the processor is outdated one, but that doesn't make any difference if u r upto for normal usage.

2541,4,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october.

2550,4,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
2551,3,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
2552,1,Awsm!
2553,4,The laptop is really good sleek design compact laptop but the charger and laptops heats really fast while charging and also when I‚Äôm using it.....

2569,4,It's quite wiser to pay more for product from Apple like MacBook Air. Flawless design and performance.
2570,5,I donno why my product is not getting validated on apple coverage site any one else facing the same problm? Btw i liked the macbook air but validation problm
2571,4,"Much better than a windows laptop Display is not so good, Performance is up to mark Battery is amazing Sound is great Touchpad is from another world Transition effects are cool Lightweight Superb build quality"

2575,5,"Slimmest, Display is above average but battery is fantastic... design is awesome."
2576,1,"Battery lasts only 6 hours with latest Mac os Catalina 10.5.6. My new Mac came with it. And now battery is only about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, its great."
2577,1,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
2578,2,Amazing
2579,3,Good perched
2580,3,One if the best purchase
2581,1,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
2582,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
2583,3,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display
2584,3,"Suprb Quality As expected.. Nice packaging.. Sexy design.. In case of OS ,For programmers and coders I think the bestest ever laptop I have been using .. Love uh Mac and Flipkart also for giving me a genuine product. Thanks a lot..."

2587,4,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.
2588,2,Awesome.... Product..... Surely go for it... Who said that Apple is not good.it's awesome... Love it.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

2595,2,This is so awesome üòä
2596,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.

2622,1,This apple macbook air is really fab in this price. The packaging was very nice. All is all i faced only 1 problem its doesn't let u create an apple id for around 3 days. But after it u can create easily so dont get panic guyees when u r not able to create it.
2623,3,Very good product value for money tough build quality and also give smoother performance
2624,1,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.
2625,2,Mind blowing super.

2644,5,Very good for coding
2645,4,The packaging n product quality is awsone. Will revert on its functioning in due course
2646,1,"I was sceptical about buying a macbook first, but I never regretted buying one. If you are in a dilemma whether to go do this or another option. Just go for this."
2647,1,Light as a notebook. Great battery life. Superb performance.
2648,4,Wonderful product by apple sure to sugest other
2649,1,I brought it to study reactjs and do some web development it‚Äôs working good as of now
2650,5,Good quality
2651,5,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
2652,3,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
2653,5,Nice product
2654,1,Very very bad display looks are excellent performance is excellent battery life and so too good but this place I have ever seen in this price range

2658,4,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
2659,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
2660,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2661,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
2662,1,Worthy of money
2663,1,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
2664,4,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
2665,4,Fall in love with this
2666,2,Good
2667,5,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
2668,2,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
2669,1,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
2670,1,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
2671,4,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
2672,1,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
2673,5,Nice product
2674,1,"Great product, my daughter love it."

2679,4,Worth
2680,1,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
2681,4,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
2682,5,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
2683,1,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
2684,1,Good
2685,1,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
2686,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
2687,4,good
2688,3,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
2689,3,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
2690,3,Macbook air is awesome.
2691,1,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
2692,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
2693,5,Best
2694,4,Superb Performance... As always Mac
2695,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
2696,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
2697,3,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
2698,5,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
2699,3,Good
2700,1,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
2701,3,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
2702,5,Great product. Just loving it.
2703,1,Nice
2704,4,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
2705,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
2706,5,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
2707,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
2708,4,sometimes the speakers are not working
2709,4,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
2710,1,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
2711,5,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
2712,5,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
2713,5,Very good
2714,3,Good Product.
2715,1,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
2716,5,Beautiful
2717,4,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
2718,3,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
2719,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
2720,5,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
2721,3,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

2766,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
2767,4,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
2768,1,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
2769,5,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
2770,5,Great laptop even in 2020
2771,3,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

2893,5,Great experience.
2894,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
2895,3,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy
2896,4,Worth of money

2919,4,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
2920,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
2921,1,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
2922,3,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
2923,4,Value for money.

3506,3,best performance good quality
3507,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.
3508,5,Awesome product...
3509,4,High performance laptop
3510,5,Macbook Air is working fine.
3511,4,"Please do not purchase any laptop from here. I purchased a MacBook. The serial number is registered in apple the website, 3 months before. And The major problem is they are not mentioning the laptop serial number in the invoice by which you can not avail any service."

And the most amazing feature is trackpad, one can do anything and everything with such trackpad. Mac is for all the users who wish their computer work flowless and respond when they wanted it to be.

3639,1,"it's iconic, it's perfect one for getting into the Mac family. new MacBook Air is not worthy enough to choose over this. surely screen is not upto date but way better than many PC's also perfect for a student. to be frank I had no expectations on it as it being a very old machine overall but in my usage I found it to be better than all PC's of that price range. all I want to say is ""IT IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC"""
3640,3,Tnx
3641,1,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

4358,3,Handling task like champ! Track pad is amazing due to gestures and size. Many things can be customizable. As name suggest Air.. Its deals with only light weight stuff .. If Straight forward to say... Macbook Air for web development presentation and some light weight coding (beginners) If u are someone who want to do app/ios development or extensively use of Tensorflow or Python for Machine learning than you should go for Macbook Pro!!

4398,5,Got a crazy cashback offer! Must buy
4399,5,Have been using for months now and these are observations. Pros: 1. build quality except the keyboard 2. sound quality 3. user interface 4. day-to-day usage 5. battery life 6. screen quality  Cons: 1. takes time getting use to if you're switching from a windows machine. 2. wifi doesn't connect automatically (not sure if it is my system issue only) 3. keyboard doesn't have enough feedback (personal opinion) 4. 13.3 inch feels a bit small  Usage: if you're only into media this laptop will work...
4400,5,World Class worst product. I never think of the apple will be such a bad product. MAC operating system is THE bad amongst all.

The design and build quality is awesome and even it's awesome if you are a programmer as I have installed code and android studio on it and ran it simultaneously and still it handled the load pretty well. üëçfor the battery backup as well and thanks Apple for raising the bar in the notebook and desktop line-up.

4501,4,Awesome
4502,4,Good
4503,5,Good product
4504,5,I am a developer and I've been using this for 2 months now. Its fantastic.  I had a wrong impression about macbook air that its just for business purposes not for heavy programming use but believe me I found my self completely wrong when I started using this machine. This is a powerful machine with 8gb of ram and SSD. I am holding windows machine with 8gb ram and more powerful processor than MacBook Air but that windows machine performance is not comparable to this as MacBook Air beats in eve...
4505,5,"Packing was good, delivered in time. Good price"
4506,5,Excellent
4507,2,After the buying MacBook air.. ...I seen why the apple is so popular....in all over world...
4508,5,Awesome
4509,5,I cant say any thing about APPLE. It is really awsome. MY hands started shivering while opening the package.
4510,5,It was an awesome experience to use MacBook air....
4511,5,"Don't keep doubts, go for it."
4512,5,During charging laptop I can feel bit current on its whole body( got 2 nos. Of plugs for charging but both are giving same effect )...this is not accepted from brand like apple
4513,1,Awesome....
4514,5,"Traditional windows users may take some time to get used to Mac OS, but once you've got fluent with it, it's a breeze to work on. In fact, for work/business related jobs too, it does cater well. The only thing I miss is Working on conventional excel sheets for which I think subscribing to office 365 should work. Only caveat is that battery backup is close to 6-6.5 hrs with regular usage, and not 8 or 10 hrs; though 6 hrs with such configuration is also pretty nice."
4515,3,No need to explain about this product.
4516,5,Good
4517,5,"Very good, worth it."

4987,4,I happy with the delivery service and hope product also will not disappointment me. Today I received this product so I m not able write about that.
4988,5,Its very bad experience ..... I ordered MacBook air ... the serial number mentioned in invoice and the actual serial number mentioned in device is different for which warranty is already 50 days over
4989,3,"It's awesome product at incredible pricing by Flipkart....... but it is giving me electrical tingling and slight current whenever I am touching my feet, bare on ground.   any help will be appreciated"
4990,5,"Genuine product. Got an Aug 17 Import, delivered in 3-4 days during Big Billion Day period. Got it at a price which is unmatched till date by anyone (online/offline). Kudos Flipkart..Keep it up!"
4991,5,The product is not having 1 year warranty it have inly for 10 months. Flipkart cheated
4992,4,"Don't take, here they mentioned easy return. But there is no return only exchange"
4993,5,Product is good. But Flipkart change the price of product from 57000 to 45000 in 15 days. Disappointed.
4994,3,You should include gst credit facility asap.
4995,4,1st apple product I bought. But the user interface and start up is not at all helpful for new buyer. I had to Google to figure out how to do things.
4996,5,I was sent a Dell laptop instead of my Macbook air. Further I am unable to request for a replacement on the flipkart website. Horrible.
4997,5,friends mein flipkart from macbook bought me from flipkart to send input from bill no more than a month from me. I do not want to send flipkart shopping
4998,5,As advertised and mentioned - both the product and delivery was spot on.  Macbook air - Its obviously a great product and when its bundled with good offer you can take a big smile.
4999,4,Good deal..
5000,5,Thanks flipcart for diwali offer Nice one.
5001,4,Product is good but machine resart unexpectedly and frequently showing kernal error.

5003,4,I got damaged product from flipkart and when I called for the replacement within 10 days I still got no response from the flipkart team. Do not buy from flipkart.
5004,5,They give used products......I hve checked through Apple warranty check site......by putting serial number of apple product u can check your product warranty
5005,5,Dilevry service is best.
5006,5,Vvv fast delivery. MacBook was very safely delivered to me with proper packing.
5007,5,Worst delivery no proper response from deliver person. Product is good.
5008,4,"Good product, runs fine. Didn't receive the transaction number with the box, though. Unable to register warranty because of that."
5009,5,Lucky toh have this.. Wow
5010,5,Heating problem i want replacement
5011,5,Thanks big billion days
5012,5,I recieved the MacBook with faulty charger.
5013,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."
5014,5,"Highly recommended, the packing was fantastic, macbook feels very rich no doubt and it has its own fluidity, i m having a gr8 experience with this beauty after switching from a windows pc. Awesome product love u mac."
5015,2,"I wanted to buy a laptoo fir mild use which will serve me smoothly for atleast 4-5 years.. im a student and my parents use it just to browse , listen to music , facetime and all those basic things.. i dont about the technical aspects so I'll give a review thats more on the informal side.... The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone ..."
5016,5,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
5017,2,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
5018,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
5019,4,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.  I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks..."
5020,5,"2017 model MacBook Air in 2019 or 2020 ?? Why not..! This is a really fabulous product, Its not about latest model or old model, I believe you need to select product based on your profession and requirements I am an IT programmer and this product fulfils my all requirements. Ever since I switch to Mac from Windows my work gets easy and efficient. The most important factor here is OS, Its superb and way way better than Windows. Tho it has 5th Gen i5 Processor, it is as good as i7 6/7th Gen i..."
5021,5,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
5022,3,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
5023,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
5024,5,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...
5025,5,"Its a beast that u can't judge without using it. I don't know what have Apple done to this laptop (you can refer it as Black Magic), Best in class performance, no other laptop can beat its speed in this price range and nearer high range laptops. And believe me you can BOAST about your battery amongst ur friends if they don't have this model with them may ot be Macbook or Macbook pro, none of the windows laptop stands anywhere infront of this little miniature beast in case of battery. You own ..."

5027,5,"This is one the best product Iam buying from flipkart thanks for the retailer ""truecomm"" I was worried how will me laptop be. But once I got my product it was fresh and branded. I bought this in big billion day offer for a cheapest price. This MacBook Air apart from everyone's negative view is a great laptop. If you are a gamer go for something else. This looks so good."
5028,5,quite frankly not worth in case you are looking to purchase a business laptop. just wasted my money on this product.  some negatives are mentioned below  1. in case you are extensive user of Excel sheets then this laptop is not for you. As majority of the functions in Excel won't work on this product. I have been told by the apple support to install Windows OS üòÇ instead if I have that kind of work  2. in case you are a gamer don't purchase this product. Processing is not optemized to ensure ...
5029,3,Nice product awsome look and performance as i expected to be But my charger is heating up‚ô®‚ô® very fast As too much that i can't hold it
5030,5,What can I say about this awesome product . Bought this laptop for android dev. Working like pro smoothly running all programs But having some heating issue sometimes feel cpu heating.
5031,1,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it. Anyways got it for 51k in Diwali offer. But even for 62k it is bett...
5032,5,"Wow amazing! what a laptop ,performance is just awesome . Best in value for money. Any cse student can get this, you will not face any software issue even if software is not available in iTunes App Store you can directly google it and download... So I‚Äôll recommend go for itüëç"

5034,2,"I have been using this Laptop from past 5Months and i hope this review will help you decide whether you should get this Laptop in 2021 or not.  1. Performance(4/5) - Macbooks has one best thing that they are very easy to use and they work very smoothly so if you switch from Windows to mac believe me you'll love the experience of Mac environment.

5035,4,Very nice laptop. Easy to use and handle like a book. Different from windows but far better than in functionality. I love it.
5036,3,Go for it even if you are buying it in 2020 or 2021. Review after 3 months. Value for money. Latest MacOS Big Sur works smooth without any trouble. Can be used both for work and personal use seamlessly.
5037,5,"very good performance and nice design of this laptop. It's quite better then windows laptop of this price range speed and processing is fast but display colours are not vibrant but its not that bad too its good for normal works. Internal SSD storage is too less its a major issue with this MacBook, one can bought the 256gb variant but its cost is high and size is also smaller. I am using this from one month and its performance is very impressive and also apple services is top class. One issue..."
5038,5,"Got it on 24th September under big bang sale for just 45k odd bucks. A truly value for money product. Prompt delivery from flip kart. Super fast, amazing look, feather light machine. Well an apple it is. So doesn't need any introduction. I have been a window users since the very beginning so a pleasant change for me."
5039,2,"I bought this in 2018 January for a whooping 44500/- deal. Apple doesn't compromise on their quality on any of their products and specially on their Mac products. Now coming to this Macbook Air A1466, this product is outdated with it's features and you don't get any authentic supplies like screen, Dock or landing zones, etc. from a third party vendor. I have tried buying them from the US as well and I'm out of choice. Hardware still supports the latest of the OS though. I have had trouble wor..."
5040,4,"I read and watched many YouTube video and decided to buy this Macbook Air but in video, Many YouTuber said that the display is not good. but it is good for day to day use. if you are editor of video and pictures, It will be problem to you but you can buy 4k monitor for That. I bought it at 52k. I have ipad pro 9.7. If you want to buy it. Go for it. Save 50k for Ipad pro. This ipad will work as extra monitor for you as well as tablet too. Editing in final cut pro is good but not tried much and..."
5041,5,"I used to make fun of Apple products being over priced and not worth the buy. I'd like to correct it, it is over priced but your spent on it is worth. After using an apple product there is no going back because they are awesome, so think before you buy because your life is going to start becoming expensive üòÇ"
5042,5,Stylish elegant and attractive.  Owsome laptop by Apple and good to use battery life and laptop performance is owsome.  Most owsome part is his trackpad the way Apple think and design the laptop trackpad is owsome.  You can not find it any other laptop.
5043,5,"First Time Using MacBook I switched from windows. MacBook is very easy to use. Its like a mobile operating system. But really very powerful and lightweight. I purchased this MacBook because editing videos and programming. Its very smoothly doing these two works. People were saying about the display that is not great but I did not found anything less into it. Display is great. Everything is great, except memory storage. But because of this every time you need to clean garbage. And you need to ..."

5045,1,"I purchased my MacBook air from Flipkart at a great festive discount. This was the most inexpensive option available in the market at any of the shopping sites. I must say that I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The quality of laptop and the performance of the machine is brilliant.

DELIVERY IS ALWAYS FAST for these products. Mine might have been an exception. Coming to laptop, Macbook is an all new experience. The laptop meets your expectations. For those switching from Windows do go through a Mac tutorials as there are a lot of hidden features which you want to unveil. PROS: Awesome battery..."
5047,3,Best laptop at best price... i got it at 43500 amazing it is :)
5048,5,"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly)."
5049,1,"Better than any windows laptop in this price range.  Perfect laptop for college students. If you are a Web Developer then it's the best laptop for you.  I have bought this laptop for Android & iOS App Development. The performance of this laptop is much more superior than any other windows Laptop.  Android Studio loads up quickly, thanks to the 128 GB SSD. It runs smoothly. There is some heating when we load the Android Emulator. Combined Android Studio & Android Emulator takes about 4GB of Ra..."

5051,5,"Well it's Apple, so you can't really go wrong with it. Battery definitely lasts for 10 hours. If you're a Windows user, Mac Os will take some getting used to. No Microsoft office, so that's always a downer. But all in all a great laptop. Can't stress how compact and travel friendly it is! Definitely worth the kidney I sold for this haha"
5052,5,"Simply The Best Laptop If U can Get It Under 50K. Most recommended for Law students and frequent travelers amazing speakers amazing speed the display doesn't feel bad if u. are upgrading from 30-40 k laptop but if u are coming down from higher specced PC or Laptop then only u can find the difference because of the smaller screen, the PPI is great so every content looks great I got it for 42K at Big.

Got this product at 45k, and having chosen the 'No cost EMI' that was available, it was an effortless purchase. One that I'm really glad of. The build quality is excellent, nothing that is offered by the counterparts running windows at this price. The OS is very beautiful, you can easily fall in love with it. And I can't say anything that ..."
5054,5,"Received the laptop in neat packaging which was delivered 2 days prior to the due date. The MacBook Air is lightweight, has great battery performance, HD display, backlit keyboard and sleek finish.  Really happy with the purchase, thank you Flipkart!"
5055,4,"it's obvious why apple products are so expensive, they work on following principles - 1. best quality in ergonomics 2. best quality in design 3.best quality in performance been over 6 months using macbook air, never have been so happy with a laptop before. got this at around 59k, updated to MacOS Mojave which is very powerful."

5060,4,Great Product. Delivered in proper packing and Delivery boy was very supportive and helpful
5061,5,"Superb machine for entry level computing. Unless you are too much obsessed with Windows OS, it is time to shift to MAC OS and it works great. Yes you can not run pirated softwares on Mac. But it is worth a try."
5062,4,"What can I say?? Its a beautiful piece just built amazingly. Love the track pad which is so soft and even though the screen is small and old, its worth every penny. Just buy it."
5063,5,"First time Mac users please read this. Best at this Price Point, even if it is increased from 55000 to 65000 within an year but still good. Yes when you are setting up your Mac please press on the trackpad because if you just click then it will not work you can change that to touch after setting up your Mac after going to settings. I use this Mac for all of my work like UI & UX Designing, 2D & 3D Animation, 3D modeling in blender, Video Editing etc. And it works great. You will find a bit he..."

The desig. js flawless ; it's lightweight , slim, gives a premium look , the touchpad design is also very simple , elegant and sophisticated . the issue which is troubling me now is the heating issue and the battery backup.

Else the design and performance is ..."
5065,4,"I was confused between this and MacBook pro. If you ain‚Äôt going to use it as a professional 4k video/photo editor or a hard core gamer go for MacBook Pro.  If you does light editing ( 1080p or less) for your YouTube channel and normal photoshop editing your photos, this machine works perfectly fine. Go for it without any doubt.  Pros: - Very Light weight - Great Performance - Cheapest Macbook available - SSD drive - Has MacOS (Virus free OS) - Great Apple ecosystem if you use iPhone and..."

5068,4,"I bought this one for stability. This one is sleek, like super sleek and sexy. Although I miss the numeric keyboard but the stability, battery and performance makes up for it. And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t..."

5074,1,"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs.

But once you learn it - you will be enjoying a fantastic experience."

Then I must recommend you for the Macbook Air. The 2017 model which I have purchased performs well even when many apps are simultaneously open.

5086,5,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.

5090,5,"Bought it during BBD at around 43.5k,. First of all I would like to thank Flipkart for such a cheap bargain and quick delivery! Coming to laptop most of us know Mac OS is beast, Build quality is awesome and i5 processor is working so smooth like butter for daily tasks!"
5091,4,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
5092,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."

So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
5094,5,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
5095,5,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
5096,3,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
5097,4,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
5098,4,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !

5100,5,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
5101,5,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
5102,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
5103,4,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
5104,5,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"
5105,5,"Hello,  Here is my Review after 10 days of purchase  Pro : 1.Smoothness 2.Superb battery backup 3. No hang, no lagging 4. After sell support from apple just wow 5. smooth for photoshop  Cons: 1. Charger problem, Overheated (May be in my case Only) 2. For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
5106,5,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1. Four Google Chrome Tabs 2. Three excel sheets 3. Two Word documents. 4. Microsoft Teams 5. Netflix 6. Youtube  I have not been able to find any performance issues so far. The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...
5107,2,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
5108,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"
5109,5,"Good product for software developer .when i used this laptop for web development and software development like python and its library its quite good for that.it also good for simple deep learning model creations and data science project . storage is less . its fast compare to windows i5, its smooth compare to windows any machines . but when i used this laptop for virtual machine it is not quite good for that bcz of less storage and i5 processor .when u used this laptop for virtual machine bat..."

5111,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).  Cons: If you are planning to play games....this is not for you, this is a..."
5112,5,"- using for coding and Xcode work well in this - space is little less , we take back in 2 months - design is great - 2017 model we get and registered into apple support website - great for browsing - for photoshop designing not so good"
5113,4,"If you are looking at a laptop with good performance and good battery life and want to do programming this laptop is for you. There are some pros and cons in this laptop.  Pros : 1. The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3. Battery life is good it gives 6-8 hours of battery backup 4. Keypad is very lite and doesn't make soun..."
5114,4,"awesomeness is the word. awesome speed, awesome battery, awesome multi tasking, awesome (light) weight, awesome touch pad (no use of mouse reqd)"
5115,5,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
5116,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
5117,4,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
5118,3,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
5119,5,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
5120,5,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
5121,2,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
5122,2,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
5123,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
5124,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
5125,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
5126,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
5127,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind.

5133,5,"I have been using macbook pro since 2 year. Now on flipkart exchanged with this macbook air at first glance it's pretty good looking device, thin, very light, attractive. Performance is good. Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
5134,5,it's just a nice product
5135,4,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.
5136,5,When open the flap and start it you get the feel of this big package come in small size and elegant design .

5140,4,It's is quite good n really amazing at 45k budget I love this product but delivery is very late. Battery backup is super very slim n well design n compacted
5141,5,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
5142,4,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
5143,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
5144,1,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
5155,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
5156,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

5158,5,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.

5178,5,"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products.

When purchasing this lap..."

Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
5206,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"
5207,5,Best for Travel.....very Handy and stylish.... best battery life .... last nearly for 10 to 12 hrs for normal use....
5208,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
5209,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."
5210,5,I Love Apple Products it is perfect match for my old I phone 5s and redmi note 4 this is awesome slick laptop and very beautiful
5211,4,"Its awesome. Use it to feel it . Switched from windows to Mac. Great UI . Handy ,simple , lovely product. Apple continues to prove itself unique, best. Flipkart delivery is fast ."
5212,5,Look and feel is very awesome. Very handy and best option for on the go use.. Good battery backup. I like the track pad feature. In very less time you will be use to of it.
5213,4,One of the finest products I've used. Extremely smooth and fluid performance. The best laptop I would recommend in the budget range of 40-50k (I bought it on offer for 44k).
5214,5,"Awesome product from Apple. Yet outdated but still best in class for the handy size easy to carry and the awesome built-quality, UI and many more"
5215,5,"absolutely awesome and ideal laptop for any college student ( except civil , mechanical engineer and architect as you guys should go for MacBook Pro as you will require extreme computing power for your designing projects) due to the fact that despite being bit underpowered on paper the permonance is as good as any windows laptop of 16 gb RAM and 8th generation i5 processor. Unless you are a hardcore gamer and can not afford the price, DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER LAPTOP other than MacBook Air if you ..."
5216,4,Ultra Slim and extra ordinary light weight. Operating system is rather easier than windows and all. Backlight keyboard with Fast charging really works great. Delivery was really fast from ekart logistics. Thanks
5217,5,"Extremely satisfied with the service of flipkart and timely delivery. Macbook Air is easily the best notebook in this category. For an user who perform daily tasks, browsing, downloading and youtube surfing, this laptop is a speed demon. Dont expect gaming on this laptop. Overall a very good laptop. Pls do considerable research about this macbook air about what it can do and what it cant do before buying, you will definitely love it."
5218,5,"Amazing Produt , very good packaging and nicely delivered . Just go for it , a big thumbs up üëç"
5219,5,The product was delivered early by a day. The delivery guys were very professional and trained unlike few others. Product is an art work not just a machine. Super light and very good finish.
5220,5,5 üåü for Flipkart's delivery. 3 üåü for laptop. Laptop is really nice and light weighted.  pros:- 1. Light weight hence portable 2. Very good battery life. 3. Fast boot up 4. Android studio and xcode runs smoothly without lag. Even emulator of Android studio runs very smoothly. 5. Mag safe port is really good thing.  cons:- 1. Its i5 5th gen which is very old. 2. Display is small but that cannot be considered as cons.  if all pros are there then why just 3 üåü? Because I feel my device is defe...
5221,5,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product. But hey, Apple is really good at giving you a Year of Warranty despite you buy it through an Apple Retailer/Reseller or through an online Reseller like Flipkart does. Though the latter one give..."
5222,5,Purchased it at heavy discounted price of Rs. 48K with Rs.8000 Cashback option from icici credit card EMI. Great product. Their courier as well as packing is very excellent.

5224,5,Awesome product cuz its Apple well the packaging was superb 2 layering and fast delivery . Thank you flipcart
5225,5,Great product at great price. And no cost EMI is an excellent option. Before ordering it on Flipkart I researched almost everywhere online. And to my surprise Flipkart was the one that offered cheapest deal.

5232,5,"This is the best budget Apple laptop one can get. Pretty light weight and great for everyday use. I have another pro - so 128 GB was good enough in my case. However, I would suggest 256 GB to be at a comfortable spot. Performs just great and battery life is excellent."
5233,5,"Flipkart rocks. With the best exchange price for my existing HP Pavilion & now, MacBook Air with such a wonderful Diwali offer !!! The product is genuine with authentic Apple packaging & the slim beast is performing magnificently. Life could not be better than this."
5234,4,First time purchaser of an apple product. MacBook is an excellent laptop. No matching no comparisons with its counterparts. Very powerful machine can do most of ur task easily. Well aluminium built body but very light to carry anywhere. Performance is excellent. Battery backup is also very gud . With my first charge I used it for a week. Very satisfied with the product. Apple product standards are unmatched in the market.
5235,2,"Very Efficient Device. Apple devices have strong integration between hardware and software hence even with lower specs on paper, it outperform windows running hardware. This Mac is good enough for daily activity, running programming IDE, emulators etc. Not meant for heavy duty gaming, but 8gb of RAM can handle moderate gaming as well. Most Amazing feature is battery life, unparalleled even when compared to macbook pro. I get 10+ hrs on moderate usage on single charge. Was a steal at 45k, a we..."

5237,4,Just awesome!!!!!! Turning Windows to Mac It's the best operating system I've ever used. Pro's:- 1-design (ultra thin led display) 2- fast charging 3- Os ecosystem 4- backlit keyboard 5-Latest upgrades 6-Epic battery life Con's: - 1-Lackluster Screen: The 1440 x 900 display on the MacBook Air isn't as sharp as those on other MacBooks and competing PCs 2- there 're plenty of apps on app store but most of them are paid version. Conclusion- The MacBook Air is a good choice as long as yo...

Takes very little time to charge Magsafe charging adapter. ( very useful)  CONS. Very average display and screen. Charger cable is very thin and flimsy. Hard disk only 128 GB But these cons are not that sig...
5240,4,Happy with the product & packing was good .  if ur looking for a Sleek and portable laptop with efficient battery then this one is a good pick. Display though is a bit on the lower side unlike the Apple retina display.  Also consider that the laptop doesnt have any lan port or hdmi port.we need to separately purchase the thunderbolt2 converters.The actual apple prices are proced above 1500 bucks.   Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.
5241,5,"Excellent Product. Worth for the price 44,990 (Bought in Big Billion Day). Good specification. Love it."
5242,4,"Product does what it is intended to do with perfection. Surfing internet and playing videos with great battery backup is just awesome. I havent tested how long does battery go but i think i am getting atleast 7.5 hrs. This is my first mac machine and i have been using win for 10 years, so switching to mac is just out of world.

5269,3,Bought the macbook for the first time. When i opened it i felt in love with the design and the quality is superb.I feel like a child as i have no idea how to operate a mac os. Mac os is easy to operate and the trackpad is simply WOW. Battery Backup is Excellent.I used it continuously for 3 hrs and the battery drained only 21%. I have more to say but i don't want to make it an essay.
5270,3,Flipkart is an authorized re-seller of apple. and you are getting huge discounts here. What more to say?
5271,5,Best laptop i ever bought...battery life is just extraordinary...super fast processor...SSD128 is more enough if you have an external HDD....only con is the display..could‚Äôve built a better display for this fantastic product. This review is after using the product for 6 months.

5280,5,"Fast boot time , excellent display, no slowness, definitely good."
5281,3,"It gives me nearly 7 hrs of battery life when I stream on YouTube, Viki etc. Even though it's only dual core yet I have never faced any kind of lag. Best thing is, if you want to do video editing it comes preloaded with iMovie, which in my opinion gets the job done for most of the people who edit videos."

5321,5,"If you love the iOS environment, want superb connectivity with your iPhone, this laptop is the best deal out there. Of course if you have the bucks, the other mac models are awesome too. The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."
5322,5,Good product with this price 56k
5323,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
5324,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...
5325,5,"Worth the penny... I was afraid about the online purchase, but Flipkart didn't made me down. It was all perfect and the MacBook Air- an awesome product by Apple. I love it"

5327,5,Good.
5328,5,Nice product
5329,5,Awesome product ...great...
5330,5,"At 45k pricepoint its the best. Lightweight as name suggests. Ssd quickly opens everything Short on storage (purchase an external hard disk or jetdrive or something like it) Battery backup the best off all laptops, more than 12hrs of backup working on docs and listening songs. Magsafe charges even quickly. Less ports so separate adapters are must Overall bestbuy at this pricepoint"

The product arrived to Kochi within 24 hrs of placing the order however it got delivered on the third day of reaching the city. It would have been just WOW if delivery was within 24 hrs of reaching the city.  The packing was very good and its import date is of Aug 2017. The os got upgraded to high sierra on updation.  The exchange o...
5334,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac. But believe me it's not that difficult. I had few issues in the beginning but you can always Google it and find the solution. Also Flipkart did the good job of delivering it as per promised.

5372,5,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
5373,5,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.
5374,5,"Thanks Flipkart, Good time delivery. Another apple brand so classic ,so elegant and beautiful. all rumours with this are just wastefull. awesome build quality, look , screen ,work absolutely flowless.  switching myself from window to macbook. Great product by apple at such price. five star."
5375,4,"A very nice laptop but is overpriced.The maintenance is too damn high.I bough this in 2018 and in 2 years this laptop broke down two times,both during june july month.The service centre told it's a common problem with macbook air.The first time it crashed it was still in warranty period and hence was repaired for free. But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y..."
5376,5,"Macbook air as a product is undoubtedly great. however a word of caution regarding the seller. Not a reliable seller. i bought it from Truecom retail and was sold by sane retails pvt ltd from telangana. when i checked the serial number of the macbook for warranty status on apple website, it showed purchase date not validated and serial number was not mentioned in the invoice. hence it was not showing 1 yr warranty. I contacted flipkart for resolving the issue and i was promised that issue wou..."

5382,5,"This is 2nd time I am facing in your exchange orders. inspite of giving all description, got harresed at the time of delivery. I hope no body will give brand new piece in exchange and for simple 1no scratch mark discount amount was reduced by RS.3800/-. I have paid the full amount and didn't opt for exchange. From next time onwards I will not opt for any item against exchange becoz felt cheated. Also will think twice to place orders to Flipkart. Honestly very dissatisfied with the service I g..."

5390,5,"I have been using Iphone for the past 6 years, so Apple products always at the First in Quality and performance. So planned to buy the Mac book now."
5391,5,A premium quality product... aluminium built...light weight... outstanding battery performance...amazing window transition optimizations...it is currently running on Mojave V10.14.4...but it has recieved an update to 10.14.6
5392,5,really the best one.... i brought it for 45k during big billion days.... Top most performance in every area....
5393,4,Dont Buy this product on Flipkart they will treat and fool you like donkey. worst customer care in the world
5394,2,"light , fast and easy to handle, good purchase"
5395,5,"No comparison with any other laptop for any task. Best machine for coding, graphic designing and business use. But, If you need a laptop for professional video editing and can spend some more money, Go for Macbook PRO..! Otherwise MacBook Air is best laptop and value for money"
5396,5,Very good
5397,5,"I am a software developer, It works fine for me."
5398,5,Suffering to adapt the iOS system while whole life spent using windows.
5399,5,nice product...if you are looking to buy new laptop and if this fit in your budget...go for this..
5400,5,"Its Mac so no need to tell anything about the product. But I must tell about Flipkart. delivery was fast, nicely packed. after two months all of a sudden my mac charger stop working, may be my bad luck. I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
5401,5,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...
5402,5,"First of all thanks to flipkart for big billion day and quick delivery. Got the product for 43500/-, one of the best deal.  No doubt that machine performs well. No heating issues and quite easy to carry around. Good battery backup as well. If may feel a bit of difficulty in using the machine initially is you are from a windows world. But it just takes few hours to familiarize and then you will enjoy the ride"
5403,5,This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...
5404,5,Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free. Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.
5405,5,"lovely sexy owsome... if u are planning to buy ; just go for it. money comes and go, but feelings of macbook will last longer"
5406,5,Superb
5407,5,display body is very loose
5408,5,Product was as exactly as described Using for a week working flawless.  One thing i got annoyed with was it got some scratches on the bottom.   Android studio and xcode working flawless
5409,5,"The laptop is awesome but please tell my friends that I've bought it by selling my Mother's Ornaments üò•cause even if I tell them, they don't believe meüòñthey would still call me borolok er bacchaüòü"

5414,2,Build quality is excellent. Mac os is fantastic. Better than Windows os. Worst experience on Flipkart delivery. Worst Delivery. But MacBook air is excellent.
5415,1,"Amazing Performance, Light Weight And Slim...Very Nice Product.üëåüëåüëåüëå"
5416,5,"After using I would say, apple again won my heart with the product performance. Far better compared to the most windows laptop."
5417,5,i bought MacBook air on big billion sale..this particular laptop is slow and charger gets hot very soon..I have used Macs earlier also but this one is the worst.. I am trying to get this my laptop exchanged but Flipkart isn't helping at all.
5418,5,"I bought it on 21 Feb 2020, the charger stopped working after 4 months. No response from customer care."

5420,5,Best laptop for programming nd web development students
5421,4,"I was looking to buy a laptop with good process speed and battery backup, i choose mac over windows this time. I have a macmini at my disposal so i was aware of the fluency mac os has. battery backup is awesome, it definitely will last for more then 8+ hours on single charge. Ppl who travel and are looking for great combination of speed and battery backup have only one option that is MacBook Air"
5422,5,"one year down the line, the motherboard is not working. please be careful while buying from this retailer"
5423,5,I purchased it for 53k during billion days. Being a developer this system doesnt hang for me even though i open n number of tools and IDEs  Absolutely loving its non lagginess and tiny classy look
5424,5,Good one
5425,5,Laptop is really good. I've bought it 2.5 years ago and working fine for first year and then suddenly I was unable to start my Mac. Display was not working but my good luck that it was still in warrenty and thus they have replaced motherboard and it started working again and after exactly one year I'm facing same issue but this time they told me that I need to replace the motherboard which coast me 42000.  I suggest not to buy this laptop.
5426,5,"I've purchased this laptop for 45k during big billion day sale and I was lucky to get it at that unbelievable price. Talking about the laptop, in 2018 it is outdated with the hardware and the design but still, it is the best buy if you got this 3 major aspects before going for a laptop : 1) Long battery life 2) Light Weight 3) Versatile Then go for it without thinking about anything else. Yeah, it is not for the gamers. I use it regularly for coding, web and movies and it is doing pretty awes..."

5429,5,I have been eyeing this macbook for the past 6 months and waited till this Big billion day. Big billion day offer was just amazing. The cost of this macbook is around 58990. I bought it for a discount of flat 13000 + 1500 on Sbi card. Ensure that Flipkart assured tag is there before checking out.
5430,5,Amazing laptop in this price range

5449,5,"It stopped working after 1 year 2 months all of a sudden. And when I took it for repair, they demanded 40k more for the repair.  That's not the quality I expect out of Apple."
5450,4,No words. Amazing amazing üòçüòçüòçthanks for flipkart.
5451,3,Damn cool! my best decision for buying this in 2019.

5453,3,Amazing Product at amazing price 44k on billion days sell.
5454,5,"flipkart is making fool to people. some thing they commit, at the exchange time they want new product. even after paying difference amount they are not ready to provide revised invoice . this is cheating .."
5455,5,amazing and so nice and slim laptop.
5456,5,"I was a skeptic regarding Mac. Why is it so costly? Turns out, you get exactly what you pay for. A premium looking laptop with great quality and battery life. After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."
5457,5,"I have used all Apple products and my experience is quite satisfactory. But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."
5458,5,been using it since 12-Aug and seems to be perfectly good Apple MacBook Air...seems to be a good investment
5459,4,"There is no question about the product, simply its awasom. And satisfied with filkart's delivery also."

5462,5,"Nice Product, Really loved it"
5463,4,Got genuine product for 45k Im soo happi
5464,5,awesome truly amazing loved it
5465,5,I am posting this 1 star not for the laptop but for Flipkart..They keep exchange offer and expect that customers will give them a brand new product in return.The pick up guy comes and cancels for scratches
5466,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
5467,5,Cool üòéüòé nice product
5468,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
5469,4,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
5470,4,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
5471,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
5472,4,It work slow
5473,5,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
5474,5,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
5475,5,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
5476,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
5477,5,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
5478,5,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
5479,5,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
5480,5,"Good service , good product, Happy with Purchase..."
5481,5,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
5482,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."
5483,5,I am using it for 3 years. So far the best experience with Apple.
5484,5,I agrer that not all with believe... but after one year you will face issue while turning the PC ON...U go to Apple Store and you willl find 5-6 persons around u complaining samr thing.. Better have another option
5485,5,I love mac book

5489,5,"Me the first time Apple Mac user. It is so stylish and with premium finish. Just started using this machine, it is way ahead of windows machine although it will take bit of time to get used to with working of mac os. Definately recommended."
5490,5,If you want performance only go for it... Good for programmers
5491,5,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"
5492,5,"Perhaps my biggest purchase online, thank u Flipkart for the offer on the product, speed is lighting fast and needless to talk much about apple which is world acclaimed. Happy to have bought the product and serves my purpose of drafting on the go"
5493,4,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
5494,3,so good
5495,4,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
5496,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class
5497,5,If you are looking for a laptop where you can do your creative things this is the best one.  Not for gamers.

5504,5,"When this laptop was not there I used many laptops like Dell, Lenovo, hp, etc. But after using this one the world has a change of mine, I am learning something new day by day. One thing I want to tell you that the Windows OS is just one type of box in front of the Mac."
5505,5,Best laptop ever for students using it from last 2 years and it still feels like new. amazing performance and battery life.
5506,5,If you wanna buy laptop and you budget is 60k then go for it
5507,5,I'm writing that review after using it for around 1 month on daily basis. Everything is working perfectly so far. I recommend that product.

5527,5,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

5537,5,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."
5538,5,"I purchased this on oct 2018. From that time I got 3 times issue. Now it is out of warranty and costing of repairing is 49,000/-. I am not happy with the product. Really very disappointed."
5539,5,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future
5540,5,"Came in good packaging , was happy with the delivery and checked the serial number, and found original. Then after 3 days , not even used and the keys are loose and started falling off ! Frustrating ! Paid a huge amount and the build quality is pathetic ! It‚Äôs in service Center !!!"
5541,5,"Bought during big billion day sale and it is fantastic deal got it @ 49990/- Premium design, a quality product from Apple. Delivery is average by ECOM. Packaging was good. Thanks flipkart overall good experience."
5542,5,Complaint product....Charger not working
5543,5,Don't buy these expensive items from Flipkart rather go to store and get new sealed pack from them after a week of purchase it started getting automatically turnedoff due to add error I don't know what the fraud being done by the Flipkart or their seller it haven't worked great my colleagues also have same and it is working fine even after 2 years . And Flipkart don't even provide replacement for these if something bad happens .
5544,5,It's best product
5545,5,Everything Is Good But Very Less Internal Storage

5549,4,"don't buy MacBook online, keyboard not working ,not repairable only replaceable"
5550,5,"I was a bit confused about this laptop as it is my first laptop. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops with higher specifications in this price range, but I'm a CSE student so i don't need any heavy laptop at all i wanted one which could last atleast 4 years and have decent battery life. I've no issue to programming with this lappy and since it is a laptop so we should be use it on a lap and take along with everywhere. Those who don't want to pla..."

5650,1,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
5651,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

5677,1,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
5678,5,Awesome
5679,5,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
5680,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!
5681,4,sexy and hot
5682,4,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
5683,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
5684,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."
5685,5,macbook doesn't need reviews because its the best.

5721,5,Really I like this product. Nice battery backup and totally different from windows.
5722,1,"No words to describe, loved the product."
5723,1,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
5724,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
5725,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."

5728,1,awsm..........
5729,5,Simply Awesome
5730,5,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
5731,2,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.

5738,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
5739,2,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
5740,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
5741,5,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!

5743,1,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours.

5749,5,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
5750,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
5751,1,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
5752,4,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
5753,1,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.
5754,5,This is the newer version with latest 2017 Sierra OS. It comes with 8GB ram. 10 hours battery life on full charge. full aluminum body.  Go for it.
5755,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
5756,5,Impressive!!!
5757,5,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
5758,1,Who else got it for 38K :D
5759,5,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
5760,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
5761,5,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
5762,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
5763,5,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
5764,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
5765,4,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
5766,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
5767,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
5768,4,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
5769,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
5770,5,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
5771,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
5772,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
5773,5,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
5774,5,nice prodect
5775,5,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
5776,5,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
5777,4,Good product but price varies
5778,5,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
5779,5,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
5780,5,Great
5781,5,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
5782,5,Amazing quality
5783,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
5784,5,Very nice products.
5785,5,Good but price high
5786,5,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
5787,5,Perfect
5788,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
5789,1,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
5790,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
5791,1,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
5792,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
5793,4,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
5794,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
5795,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
5796,5,charget not found
5797,5,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
5798,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
5799,5,I think window is better system Crashes
5800,5,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
5801,1,Very nice product apple MacBook air
5802,1,Superb product
5803,5,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
5804,5,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
5805,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
5806,1,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
5807,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
5808,1,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
5809,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
5810,5,Stunningly superb
5811,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
5812,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
5813,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
5814,1,It's a good product but not value for money
5815,5,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube

5818,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."

5833,4,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

5864,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

5908,5,Just Amazing
5909,5,Good
5910,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
5911,5,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
5912,5,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
5913,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.
5914,5,Hard to get familiarised first. Memory space is an issue. Overall good experience

5979,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

6052,1,Awesome laptop in amazing price
6053,2,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
6054,3,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."
6055,2,Good timely delivery by Flipkart
6056,4,"Always wanted to buy a MacBook. Purchased for 59k.  Although the model runs down to 2017, still worth every penny in 2020.  Comes updated with latest Mac OS Catalina 10.15."

6076,5,Beautiful
6077,2,After using for more than 6 months I can say the product is good. Good for normal uses and weather home or office. In this price the product is good..but if some one looking for best Processor more than i5 Or long video edits or longer time cpu usage may this will not meet you requirements.
6078,3,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app). Literally, I am getting 12 hours of battery. There is no issue of heating...."
6079,5,"The best apple product for a student, affordable. Being a commerce student (MBA) it's very easy to install & use MS office. People say it's difficult to run MS Office, it's myth. Believe me it works much better than a windows laptop. Overall product quality is best, very light weight and easy use, battery is very very good, the processor is outdated one, but that doesn't make any difference if u r upto for normal usage.

6107,1,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october. I received it in new condition. I checked :  1. Delivery is good 2. Serial number matches with apple box and also warranty start on shipping date which is 27 3. No sratch or dent on macbook 4.

I had many negative thoughts regarding the seller ...as when I researched about the seller i.e. ""True Com Retail"" , there were many negative feedbacks from the customers ....but I took the risk and ordered this MacBook at approx 60k...in the Big Diwali Sale. When the delivery agent gave me the product...I noticed that the seal of the flipkart on the outer package w..."
6116,4,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
6117,1,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
6118,3,Awsm!
6119,1,The laptop is really good sleek design compact laptop but the charger and laptops heats really fast while charging and also when I‚Äôm using it.....

6135,4,It's quite wiser to pay more for product from Apple like MacBook Air. Flawless design and performance.
6136,5,I donno why my product is not getting validated on apple coverage site any one else facing the same problm? Btw i liked the macbook air but validation problm
6137,5,"Much better than a windows laptop Display is not so good, Performance is up to mark Battery is amazing Sound is great Touchpad is from another world Transition effects are cool Lightweight Superb build quality"

6140,4,Overall nice laptop for programmers!
6141,5,"Slimmest, Display is above average but battery is fantastic... design is awesome."
6142,5,"Battery lasts only 6 hours with latest Mac os Catalina 10.5.6. My new Mac came with it. And now battery is only about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, its great."
6143,5,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
6144,4,Amazing
6145,4,Good perched
6146,5,One if the best purchase
6147,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
6148,5,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
6149,4,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display
6150,5,"Suprb Quality As expected.. Nice packaging.. Sexy design.. In case of OS ,For programmers and coders I think the bestest ever laptop I have been using .. Love uh Mac and Flipkart also for giving me a genuine product. Thanks a lot..."

6152,5,"Loved it!  Delivery executive was way too generous and soft spoken. Both, product and flipkart services (seller inclusive) are superb. Packaging was outstanding. Keep up the good work. Thanks for your service!"
6153,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.
6154,5,Awesome.... Product..... Surely go for it... Who said that Apple is not good.it's awesome... Love it.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

6161,5,This is so awesome üòä
6162,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.

The model is 2017 which misses the fingerprint and Retina display from 2018 model. Pretty decent for android studio for mobile app development. The power on time is impressively lo..."
6168,5,Battery was awesome.. Performance management was really good. Note* Not for gamers.. Rest go blindly...
6169,5,Good laptop. I got it for 56k worth it. Display is not great. You can buy lifetime subscription of office at 2000 for those who are worried about office.

6189,5,Very good product value for money tough build quality and also give smoother performance
6190,4,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.

Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
6225,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
6226,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
6227,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
6228,5,Worthy of money
6229,4,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
6230,1,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
6231,5,Fall in love with this
6232,3,Good

6235,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
6236,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
6237,4,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
6238,4,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.

6247,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
6248,5,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
6249,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
6250,5,Good
6251,1,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
6252,4,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
6253,5,good
6254,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
6255,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
6256,5,Macbook air is awesome.
6257,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
6258,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
6259,5,Best
6260,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
6261,1,Very good...it is mind-blowing
6262,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
6263,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
6264,5,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
6265,5,Good
6266,4,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
6267,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
6268,5,Great product. Just loving it.
6269,5,Nice
6270,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
6271,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
6272,4,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
6273,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
6274,4,sometimes the speakers are not working
6275,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
6276,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
6277,5,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
6278,5,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
6279,5,Very good
6280,5,Good Product.
6281,1,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
6282,4,Beautiful
6283,4,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
6284,4,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
6285,5,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
6286,5,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
6287,5,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

6312,4,Manufacturing defective
6313,4,I have purchased 10days back at price 63k. Nice Product value for money. Quick task processing no bufferer with 20 application running simultaneously. Excellent resolution and clarity for movies and pictures as well as sound in alse appreciable.

6316,5,Awesome
6317,5,Satisfied.

6319,5,This laptop heats on charging. Charger gets hot within a minute of plugging. Not worth buying. There is no exchange policy on Flipkart. Really sad.

6332,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy

6334,5,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
6335,5,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
6336,5,Great laptop even in 2020
6337,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

7048,5,"the product is good, but even if you finds any defect in macbook there is no option to return it on the flipkart, then why to buy on it, it will show the link to copy n paste and you keep running their service center."

7072,5,best performance good quality
7073,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.
7074,4,Awesome product...
7075,4,High performance laptop
7076,5,Macbook Air is working fine.
7077,5,"Please do not purchase any laptop from here. I purchased a MacBook. The serial number is registered in apple the website, 3 months before. And The major problem is they are not mentioning the laptop serial number in the invoice by which you can not avail any service."

And the most amazing feature is trackpad, one can do anything and everything with such trackpad. Mac is for all the users who wish their computer work flowless and respond when they wanted it to be. If you want that kind of performance from machine from window it will definitely cost you a way more than wh..."

7206,1,Tnx
7207,5,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

After I went through a couple of you tube tutorials on how to use mac, it is was quite easy for me. Th build quality of the product is awesome. Battery life is superb. Although the display could have been better but it is still value for money.  On the whole a good buy"

7383,5,"The delivery of the package was late than what was expected, also the guy came to exchange the product has cheated me as he has picked up the device from my end but in the order details it is mentioned exchange device cancelled and remaining amount paid in cash. Please flipkart look into these thing and one more thing the invoice for the laptop was missing in the package, how user will claim warranty if you will not provide the same."

7406,5,I am quite disappointed with the way Flipkart handles product exchanges. The laptop that was supposed to be exchanged was in perfect good shape. I am not sure what Flipkart expects to be the standards for an exchange product. A tiny scratch on the screen and the product is rejected.

7442,5,the brand apple itself justifies the product.....the packaging was good and fast as compared to other flipkart product totally satisfied and happy and would recommend other also to buy this......if you are lightweight user and minimal programming is your need with basic media consumption then this is your best laptop.tons of customisation for handy usage while if you think of doing some intensive task then forget about it because it lacks performance but for daily usage and portability thumbs...

7744,5,Handling task like champ! Track pad is amazing due to gestures and size. Many things can be customizable. As name suggest Air.. Its deals with only light weight stuff .. If Straight forward to say... Macbook Air for web development presentation and some light weight coding (beginners) If u are someone who want to do app/ios development or extensively use of Tensorflow or Python for Machine learning than you should go for Macbook Pro!!
7745,5,great buy except sceptical about the butterfly keyboard since it's prone to get damaged.

7785,5,Have been using for months now and these are observations. Pros: 1. build quality except the keyboard 2. sound quality 3. user interface 4. day-to-day usage 5. battery life 6. screen quality  Cons: 1. takes time getting use to if you're switching from a windows machine. 2. wifi doesn't connect automatically (not sure if it is my system issue only) 3. keyboard doesn't have enough feedback (personal opinion) 4. 13.3 inch feels a bit small  Usage: if you're only into media this laptop will work...

7887,5,Awesome
7888,5,Good
7889,4,Good product
7890,5,I am a developer and I've been using this for 2 months now. Its fantastic.  I had a wrong impression about macbook air that its just for business purposes not for heavy programming use but believe me I found my self completely wrong when I started using this machine. This is a powerful machine with 8gb of ram and SSD. I am holding windows machine with 8gb ram and more powerful processor than MacBook Air but that windows machine performance is not comparable to this as MacBook Air beats in eve...
7891,5,"Packing was good, delivered in time. Good price"
7892,1,Excellent
7893,1,After the buying MacBook air.. ...I seen why the apple is so popular....in all over world...
7894,4,Awesome
7895,5,I cant say any thing about APPLE. It is really awsome. MY hands started shivering while opening the package.
7896,5,It was an awesome experience to use MacBook air....
7897,4,"Don't keep doubts, go for it."
7898,4,During charging laptop I can feel bit current on its whole body( got 2 nos. Of plugs for charging but both are giving same effect )...this is not accepted from brand like apple
7899,5,Awesome....
7900,5,"Traditional windows users may take some time to get used to Mac OS, but once you've got fluent with it, it's a breeze to work on. In fact, for work/business related jobs too, it does cater well. The only thing I miss is Working on conventional excel sheets for which I think subscribing to office 365 should work. Only caveat is that battery backup is close to 6-6.5 hrs with regular usage, and not 8 or 10 hrs; though 6 hrs with such configuration is also pretty nice."
7901,5,No need to explain about this product.
7902,5,Good

8209,4,Macbook air is absolutely stunning. Timely delivwry and everything with product is perfect.
8210,5,Excellent laptop. It was a warm change from the old laptop i was using. The functions are very comfortable though the users who are more acquaint woth windows might face issues with the system initially. It was surprising to see such a boot time (definitely in a pleasant way). Overall a good buy but might pop a little hole in your pocket.
8211,4,I have received the product two days ago in a well packed condition. It is very good looking. Still now working nicely.
8212,2,So happy to receive my first book on this auspicious day.Delivey was earlier than the promised day. Just started using.Tremendous feeling.So easy to use.This Mac book is really worth for the 49 k I paid Thank you Flipkart.... Flipkart Rocks

8280,5,Very good and genuine product. All as per expectations. Buy it without any second thoughts. Got it at a very low price i.e 45k from flipkart. Only one thing dissapointed me i.e the order was processed on the last day of expected delivery date and they extended it to next date.
8281,1,Apple is awesome
8282,1,Every thing is good but you guys delayed shipment of product. Sometimes the delivery of product is more important rather than product. Otherwise everything is good.

8292,4,"Macbook Air i recieved was well packed and reached within time. The product is superb in every aspect, many complained about its screen resolution but for me its good looking and has new touch to it. Macbook is well constructed and has very sleek design. Aluminium body makes it stand in its top position of looks. Its blazingly fast and has very less weight than i thought. Im pretty much overwhelmed FLIPKART üòé keep it up"

8295,1,"Seriously awwsm .. pls go for it without any hesitation.. the performance look wise so good budget friendly... Can be used for online class, online xms, browsing,and also for mid range games, basic level programming tally and all.. preferable to clg students"
8296,5,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
8297,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
8298,3,"it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .  When you use it for office work then download WPS office it's good and featur..."
8299,5,"a god product for students, i'm writing this review after use of 1 month, if you use it only for online class and watching you tube then it's best for you & also its consumes less data if you setting in metered connection. so don't worry about data consumption.  pros- good battery back up & charging very fast, clear resolution screen and it's comes with a classy look  cons- a little bit slower, * It's takes 30-40 sec to open and after open it takes 3-5 sec to being ready to use and the ref..."

8301,5,"Writing this review after full 24 hours of putting this machine to grind. I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not? However, this piece of beauty is well equipped to go smoothly with my expectations of a big clear display, clear voice and word/pdf typing/reading works. A word of caution to the gamers though.. Don't go for this if you are into high end games. Othe..."
8302,5,"Laptop is definitely value for money!! Also the clock speed is little slow but it works perfectly fine for office work, studying and streaming movies/series!. Good laptop at a good price, also this laptop is good if you are a first time buyer. Just so that you all know...I am writing this review after using the laptop for 2 whole days."
8303,5,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...
8304,5,"Product was good while delivering... The laptop works slow for first two days now it is ok... I like it... In below 30,000 range laptop,this was worth with windows 10..."
8305,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
8306,4,"Very Good in Display Quality. keyboard /Mouse Good. Processing is something , just something slow....but its good.. Over All I found this A Great Office work Laptop , so that i want. 5 mein se phir bi 4.5 dunga.."
8307,5,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
8308,5,Overall below average laptop not worth buyin nothing noteworthy pretty much not worth the money Ps: not recommended to buy only if u can custom install and remove the stock parts
8309,5,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc."
8310,5,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works
8311,5,"Nice product for normal & jenuine home use only , and value for money. Proud on me for good choice"
8312,1,It's a decent product at a price of 20000. Does the job at the price point. Dont expect it to behave like i5 or i3. But overall good product
8313,1,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...
8314,5,"Amazing product under this price range. It's stylish design, powerful processor and budget friendly is perfect for basic use. Really thankful to flipkart for delivering this amazing product on time."

8335,5,Good Laptop for Beginners...
8336,2,Laptop stopped responding from today (purchase date 29 Dec 2019)
8337,1,Don't ever buy this product trust me you will suffer later...don't buy this product
8338,1,"I recieved the laptop on 3rd June,after 2 days there was display issue and laptop was getting automatically shutdown and it's taking 5 mins to switch on again.I raised the issue and got the laptop replaced after 25 days.I recieved the replaced laptop on 27th June ,it was working fine for first 2 days and today same issue of blank screen display occurred again along with that there is issue in switching on the laptop as well.Sorry to say,but this laptop brand is below third classüò°üò°"
8339,5,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.
8340,5,Good
8341,1,The laptop is best in very cheap price
8342,4,"Light weight, much better than expected. Thank you so much dear flipkartüòäüôè 1st day service awsm üëç"

8366,5,Booting problem add 2 3 more thousand on your budget and get good config laptop.
8367,4,very best product
8368,5,"Very slow, not up to the mark...."
8369,5,Don't waste money on this product. Its very slow. Stop inbetween your work. Takes long time to open file folders everything. Even you can't take online classes properly in one go from this device its takes large time for every action.
8370,5,üòçüòòüòòüòòüòçThanks flipkart &asus
8371,5,"Please don't waste your money on this. It is the worst laptop I have ever used. It takes 5 to 6 min to open simple app like microsoft edge, ms word. Etc. It is too slow can't even rely it for typing"
8372,5,"Absolutely waste of money. Do not buy this laptop. It's so slow that you can literally miss whole class by the time it boots and connects. It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications. Restarting this is absolutely headache and just keep seeing the circle in front. Sometimes it appears that there is no processor inside. Bought it for kids online class with basic functionality but my 'chintoo' threw on day on..."
8373,5,"Waste product, always hanging while starting the windows it's keep on hanging, packing also very worst.. Please don't buy the product by seeing the photos and features, going to return the product"
8374,5,Don't even consider this laptop just for cheaper rate. This laptop is a trap in this rate. Just after 3 day use . The laptop now don't even turns on. If by chance it turns on by mistake u can't see anything all blank .
8375,5,This is not good product it's prosesser is verey slow image not clear it is very bed laptop
8376,5,This is most worst laptop i ever purchased it cost me 24000 and then too battery and charging problem starts as soon as u start using it .bilieveme never bythis product
8377,5,"PRODUCT IS NOT UP TO THE MARK AS SHOWN ON THE WEBSITE , FLIPKART SAY REPLACEMENT POLICY BEWARE THEY EVEN DONT PROVIDE THE PRODUCT UPGRADATION POLICY. VERY SLOW, SLOW WIFI CONNECTIVITY, HANGINNG IN SEARCHING FROM THE TASK BAR. MAKE SURE DONT FALL FOR THE TRAP LAID BY ASUS."
8378,5,Late delivery of a crucial product ! Caps lock key doesn't even have a light to indicate if it's on unless we type and find it out! Neither invoice nor guarantee card provided. Slow performance and average battery life.
8379,1,Nice laptop . I am writing this after 15 day use. Best at this price
8380,5,Very slow processing speed.
8381,1,"Not at all happy with the product as the keyboard is uplifted as in the keys are coming out, it hangs and works very slow while using Excel and inspite of being a brand new laptop it restarts very slowly. Have no option other than getting it as replacement as per the sellers policy. So waiting for replacement to come and see what happens with it."
8382,5,Very Bad product and services
8383,4,Good laptop for daily use but not for gamer Screen is good also speaker
8384,5,Best
8385,5,Tooo good ü§ü‚ù§
8386,5,Nice laptop for students. Not for heavy user.Very lite weight laptop and good in performance. Asus give a nice product.
8387,5,Its really slow machine and took minutes to boot. I have updated window as well but speed is really slow. Actually dualcore works only with xp not for window 10. Better if you can few more thousands and buy I3 or i5
8388,5,Good
8389,5,Fantastic look... Thank u flipkart
8390,5,"Who the hell used this laptop, it is very worst, how you gave 3.9 star.... It is worst product... Without opening any Task the disk size is crossing 100% and CPU as well... Dont buy this product..."

8393,5,Don't buy it. It taking longer time to switch on. And processing speed is very slow.
8394,5,overall good with this price range
8395,5,"In this range it's very effective for those who are only want to normal use like online classes,browsing etc. We can say it's only for beginner üòä"
8396,1,Thankyou flipcart
8397,5,Best budget laptop in market.. right choice for students for online classes..
8398,1,Do not buy this..you will feel it is value for money but you do not get anything. The speed and performance is horrible. You cannot even open 2 tabs at a time. I tried to increase RAM but cannot do it as it has 4 GB inbuilt RAM and you can only add SSD which is costly. They lied that you can increase the RAM by 16 GB but you cannot
8399,5,Laptop is not turned on after 20 usage and waste of money. ASUS support team is too lazy and no response from them
8400,5,Not upto that i want and i think so much slow processor don't buy please if you have budget then only purchase another lap top don't purchase this one with low budget
8401,1,Very bed laptop

8403,1,This is not compartable to online classes it's very poor quality

However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.  No company pays attention to ..."

If someone is looking for laptop to done basic things like to watch movie, store the data, learn basic features in which high power processor not needed then this laptop is the best at this price.

But it's absolute waste of customer's money.  DON'T BUY!"

8750,5,Good but not bad
8751,5,I THINK WINDOWS 10 with this specification is biggest cons in this laptop . Hardware is not optimised for windows 10 so it makes windows very laggy .. If you can spend 2k or 3k and buy a SSD then it could be super fine

9132,5,Good but prossses is slow
9133,4,"Good for beginners, slow booting , speakers are good"
9134,5,The laptop is a mid segment and offers basic features for students as well as professionals. The laptop is of decent performance and is light weight and has all basic features.
9135,5,It's quite slow even when you just setting it up. But i guess it's value for money. You get enough for the amount you paid.

9147,5,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."

9150,5,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
9151,5,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
9152,5,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
9153,4,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
9154,5,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
9155,5,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
9156,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
9157,5,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
9158,5,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
9159,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
9160,5,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
9161,5,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
9162,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
9163,4,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
9164,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
9165,5,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
9166,5,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
9167,5,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
9168,5,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
9169,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
9170,5,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
9171,5,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
9172,5,"It's a good laptop, ideal for students and office work. But it's not for coding and programming 4gb ram is less for this. Initially the laptops hangs and a bit slow but after all the security patch and windows update it runs completely fine. Battery life is not as good also AMD processor consume more power and camera is really bad.Also this colour gets dirty very easily. Till now I'm not finding any more problem. I'm writing this review after 10days. I got it for rs.31,990/ at this price this..."
9173,4,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
9174,5,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
9175,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
9176,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
9177,2,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
9178,5,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
9179,5,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
9180,5,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
9181,5,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
9182,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
9183,5,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
9184,5,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
9185,5,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
9186,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation. One more USB p..."
9187,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."
9188,5,I got this laptop in 23k in bbd sale . Design wise this is beautiful laptop but handle with extra care Display of this laptop is not bad it is full hd and too bright but viewing angle make me unhappy other wise gud display.

9189,5,This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
9190,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
9191,5,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

I hardly had any expectation with this laptop, still I am utterly disappointed.

9248,5,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
9249,5,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
9250,1,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
9251,4,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
9252,5,"Don't think of buying this product. Trust me, you will regret to the deepest point. Highly disappointed with not just Lenovo but Flipkart too."
9253,2,A decent laptop for the money you paid üëçüëç
9254,4,Overall good performance no hanging issue sleek slim light small as per latest laptops comes in this price good with lenovo brand I use lenovo 9-8 years lenovo I have face no issue yeah price is fluctuated but good under 26-27k price
9255,5,Display is awesome. Performance bad Battery average. Overall a decent one.
9256,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
9257,2,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
9258,3,4GB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DEVICE. IT SHOULD BE INCREASED UP TO 8GB AS SOME PROGRAMS TAKE LONGER TIME IN STARTING.
9259,5,"Don't go for it Bought it before 6 months, not working now!!!"
9260,4,This is bad
9261,5,"Don't purchase this laptop, running very slow after 1-2 week use"
9262,5,That product is low quality. Slow processor.no need to buy this
9263,5,"Don't buy , worste laptop"
9264,5,Laptop is too slow. Even windows 98 pc is faster than this laptop.
9265,1,Within 8 months keyboard is not working properly Full of hang problem s don't by this don't even where to complaint
9266,1,Laptop functioned only for8 months. Never ever buy e-goods thru Flipkart. They won't provide any after sales services. I reported the matter to Flipkart and Lenovo but the matter not cleared even after two weeks.l lost my money.
9267,1,If you sleep this laptop and reopen it takes 30 to 100sec It's very slow Not value for money after 1 month
9268,4,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.
9269,3,Worst product. Don't buy it. Very slow laptop. Don't waste your money. Go for dell or hp
9270,5,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low.... Camera quality poooor.. üò¨ Except this it's the.... Best.... Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç
9271,4,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
9272,5,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
9273,1,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
9274,1,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
9275,5,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
9276,1,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
9277,1,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
9278,3,Simply waste
9279,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
9280,1,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
9281,1,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
9282,5,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
9283,1,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
9284,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
9285,2,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
9286,5,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
9287,1,Go for it.
9288,1,Good
9289,5,Nice
9290,1,Nice
9291,1,Osome product
9292,5,Nice
9293,5,Good laptop in this budget...
9294,5,Awesome
9295,5,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
9296,4,Little bit slower but value for money
9297,1,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº

9306,5,Good
9307,5,Nice product
9308,5,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
9309,3,Best buy for this budget

9322,5,Good time delivery....
9323,5,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

9334,5,Ok
9335,5,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."
9336,5,"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good"

9362,5,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
9363,5,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."
9364,5,Super laptop NYC look
9365,4,Battery is poor..2hrs maximum..hangs sometimes.. Not recommended. Windows 10 and Ms Office is there. The Design of the lap is good.

9374,5,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
9375,5,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
9376,5,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
9377,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
9378,5,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
9379,5,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.
9380,5,Nice Laptop....
9381,5,Good performance and battery
9382,5,Very slow.
9383,5,Useless Product
9384,5,Very bad
9385,5,"System performance is really pathetic. For opening one web browser will take 5 minutes after clicking it. Not installed any softwares other than operating system and related files. As per lenova service desk, RAM need to upgrade. But i dont think so. Looks like something abnormal with the laptop. Money wasted."

9391,2,Worst product since i bought its not at all working gettinv switched off aftr every 10 mins
9392,5,Worst laptop I ever had...it's slower than a tortoise. Stupid thing takes 10 minutes to start and 15 minutes to shut. No laptop service station is understanding the problem and asking more money to improvise the hardware. Worst decision ever.
9393,5,Very slow and not user friendly
9394,5,Worst experience
9395,5,Working good after update.....
9396,5,Best for this price range.

9405,5,Good
9406,5,Worst laptop. Very slow performance.
9407,5,I purchased this laptop because of it's price but now I think it was a big mistake if you are reading this I request you not to purchase it. It is extremely slow and it's battery life is really bad. It gets irritating at time because it is too slow. And hang even while using a normal search engine. It would be better if you spend more 10000 and buy a better machine
9408,5,Very nice products
9409,4,"That's value for money......it's not a high performance machine but it's excellent in office,students,home usage,coding,light gameing,watching online content like Amazon prime videos,Netflix...ect.

9410,1,Very very poor performance. Not even worth for 10k. At least i should have have buy good laptop with 10k worth in seconds which performs better. Very very disappointed with the product. I will not at all recommend this worst product. Please Don't go with rating and reviews. Check the performance lively before purchase it.
9411,5,"Iam using this laptop for about 9 months..... Firstly this laptop is not intended for heavy task , usually only for office works and media entertainment...This cannot be used for online class, because it have 0.2MP camera only...

9420,5,Battery is too poor
9421,5,After using 10 months i am giving review. Problem- 1.This laptop is good but if you work on multitasking its disk used 100% so you fill like hanging laptop. When you add m.2 SSD this problem will be solved. 2. Its (elan)touchpad driver is not fully integrated with this cpu so it not work fully smoothly.  And all things are good in this laptop.
9422,4,Excellent design Poor performance.. Dead slow Battery charge is nt satisfactory

9579,5,Some time it very slow working and battery Draining so fast but in this price it is a valuable laptop.
9580,5,Hanging problem

9583,5,Very slow
9584,5,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
9585,5,Very slow
9586,5,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
9587,2,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
9588,5,It's getting fan sound heavy
9589,5,Nice product
9590,3,Worst performance
9591,4,Good.......
9592,3,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
9593,4,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
9594,5,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
9595,4,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
9596,4,Poor defect product

9598,5,Nice laptop took for my brother.
9599,5,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
9600,5,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
9601,5,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
9602,2,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
9603,1,Battery down fast.. Works slow Hanging many times As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
9604,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it

9606,5,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
9607,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."
9608,5,Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.
9609,5,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
9610,5,This laptop is very good at this price range but if you'll need onsite support then I must say their customer support is terrible unless you live in a developed area.
9611,5,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
9612,5,"It is just fine for everyday use. Working nice and fast as expected. You can play 8k video also, battery drains when you give multiple task and play high resolution video, but it can give you atleast 3 hour battery backup. It has windows 10 Home single version upgradeable to most recent 20H2."
9613,5,Awesome project
9614,1,Buy this laptop if you want to regret your life please dont be fooled with the low price it is not worth it Please dont buy and waste your money Very very very poor performance It hangs very badly as soon as you install a software so pls dont buy and waste your money like i did Just worked well for one month then its totally gone i am unable to replace it as the return policy has expired

9622,5,One of the the best product on this price range
9623,5,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
9624,1,Waste of Money
9625,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!

9630,5,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
9631,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
9632,5,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
9633,4,Not bad
9634,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
9635,5,good one
9636,2,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
9637,1,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
9638,4,Superb product lenovo

9648,5,Bettery is not better
9649,5,"Laptop is dead slow I never expected ghis from Lenovo especially, why did they released such an laptop. If we want to upgrade the memory also no info provided in bios regards to speed in MHz.  To those people who want to purchase this one kindly look for Other laptops."

9663,5,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
9664,5,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
9665,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
9666,5,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
9667,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
9668,5,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
9669,5,All is well
9670,5,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
9671,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.

9679,5,Good product
9680,5,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
9681,5,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
9682,5,Nice
9683,5,One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.
9684,5,Overall good machine for basic work.  Using aroun 8-9 hours a days.  Battery -3-4 hrs average  Display 4/5  Performance 4/5
9685,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
9686,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance
9687,1,its overall performance of battery is very low with in one hr the 100% battery draining out very bad performance
9688,5,"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor. But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved. Flipkart customer support is very bad, they only provide assurance, not resolution. I does not get McAfee antivirus 12 month subscription. Today 15 days are going to end of delivery but still not getting Antivirus license key."
9689,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"
9690,5,Speaker volume is very low as of my openion rest the laptop is good for basic uses....
9691,5,Nice
9692,5,Buy it....awesome product..ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
9693,5,"Over all ok, display quality is not good, performance is not bad."

9699,5,laptop is very slow in performance and it hangs while opening 2-3 tab in chrome...don't buy...
9700,5,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
9701,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
9702,4,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
9703,5,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
9704,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
9705,5,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
9706,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
9707,4,Very very very slow.
9708,5,Fully value for money purchase.
9709,5,Good deal
9710,5,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

9718,1,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."

9741,4,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
9742,5,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.
9743,5,Slow Laptop

9753,5,Bat
9754,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
9755,5,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
9756,5,Good
9757,5,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
9758,5,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
9759,1,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
9760,5,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
9761,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
9762,5,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
9763,4,Nyc
9764,5,Awesome laptop..
9765,5,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
9766,1,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
9767,5,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
9768,5,Built quality is poor
9769,5,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
9770,5,Very good laptop of this price.
9771,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
9772,5,Wonderful laptop
9773,1,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
9774,5,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
9775,3,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
9776,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
9777,2,not bad at this price
9778,5,Nice Look and Video clearly is good
9779,1,Good quality laptop....

9794,5,This product is to much good and thank you flipkart
9795,5,I m Fully Satisfied üî•‚ù§
9796,5,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
9797,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
9798,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
9799,5,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb
9800,5,It's very nice I loved the slim body of the laptop the function the keys every thing.its excellent gud product to buy and use it nodoubt
9801,5,Good
9802,5,It's a very good laptop at the price of under 25k Only thing is that the 4GB Ram is not sufficient for this because in 4GB model it is little bit lagging...Rest all things is good specially build quality and weight...ü§©ü§©ü§©
9803,5,The laptop is completely waste of money it's getting to late to open and hanging tooo much it is not the good product ..waste of money and waste of time .we never expect this from flipkart
9804,5,Very very slow and too lagging
9805,5,Mcfee antivirus not working that was pre-installed for 1 year subscription free

9809,5,Value for money..... satisfied with the product
9810,5,Edited review.  Worst decision of my life buying this garbage. Utter waste
9811,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
9812,5,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
9813,5,Very nice product i love it .
9814,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
9815,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
9816,5,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
9817,4,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."
9818,5,A must buy laptop under 25k!!
9819,5,Slow perfamence
9820,5,Display screen is not that steady.Initially struggle to activate office. Overall good budget laptop
9821,5,"You cannot open 3apps simultaneously, for the same prize you can prefer avita ryzen 5 with 550gb add"
9822,4,It take ages to start .. nothing installed yet takes 20 min for bootup... Better buy some other brand
9823,5,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
9824,5,Good
9825,4,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
9826,5,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
9827,5,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again
9828,5,Good
9829,4,Keyboard is not working
9830,5,Worth buy
9831,5,"Using this for 2.5 months now. Primarily to attend Online meetings, Online Classes, Email and working on documents. No complaints at all now. Affordable, looks good, works well. Hope the nice experience continues."
9832,5,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.

9835,5,Very sluggish
9836,4,Average Performance
9837,5,Nice Product
9838,5,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
9839,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
9840,5,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
9841,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
9842,5,Nice productüòä
9843,5,I am using this laptop from 3 months... This is the best laptop in this price range... Best for your office work...No lagging (disable start up of affecting apps) For students it is perfect to learn and attend online classes... No buffering while playing Asphalt 8...  Just Go For It...
9844,1,Product is good but due some network settings fan started running continuously for 3 days then i went to reset network settings then it has been stopped.....
9845,5,display problem within 2 months
9846,1,Satisfaction
9847,5,"Battery performance is not good. Apps launch very slowly, patience is the key even for normal usage of this laptop."
9848,5,very bad product. continuous issue with laptop
9849,5,Very slow performance and worst service from Lenovo..
9850,5,Very slow system.I won't recommend anyone to buy
9851,5,Very nice product at cheaper prices
9852,1,"The Laptop was working fine eventually however later the battery life decrease drastically & the processor slowed down, now it feels like I clicked on n icon q century back & it just loaded the page."
9853,5,Don't even think of buying this if u do that u gonna waste Ur money... It take almost 10-15 minutes even to copy and paste a 30-40 mb file and u know what is even more frustrating that u even can't do anything else while it is copying bcoz it will hang if u try to do so.... Very slow laptop ...my old laptop that I got from gov. For free was better than this....won't buy it even if someone is selling it for 5000 only
9854,5,Good
9855,5,Its the worst laptop. Don't think I am a lenovo hater . Its problems 1. Battery backup is only 1 hour after fully charged 2. Don't even think of buying it for gaming . FPS is low and the laptop hangs . Even with 1gb graphic card and 4 gb ram it sucks
9856,4,Must buy. Excellent and is all rounder
9857,5,Most perfect
9858,5,Pros: ryzen3 is good @this price range : Good display : Premium looking design Cons: build quality is not that good : Touch pad is not so responsive : Hdd
9859,5,Awesome product.. Delivery in 2 days...
9860,5,Performance is good...
9861,5,Nice just loved it.....
9862,3,Product very good but just sometime.lag this device.
9863,5,"I am writing this review after using this product more than a month. Processor is very slow, it's even hangs up if we work on more than 3 windows at the same time. To me I doubt that the company is actually installed RYZEN 3 processor, since it's seems to be working on some really old processor. Battery backup is also not very impressive all together is not the value for money at all."
9864,5,"Hangs alot. Performance is also very slow. It was having 10days replacement, but these 10days almost take for product installation and after thay when we start to qork gradually things comes up which become hell to even qork"
9865,5,Battery backup is not good
9866,5,"It has not even been a year, and the laptop is terribly slow, mouse has stopped working and one key kept auto typing until I disabled it with external software. I called the customer care, five days back, they haven't sent the engineer yet. My experience is not good with this device since beginning. I Do not recommend this laptop."
9867,5,Takes more than 10 minutes some times to open 1 excel file. Very slow processing
9868,3,Slow. Poor battery
9869,5,Worst things ever purchase Mother board note work after 1 month..
9870,5,Over all good product
9871,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
9872,5,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
9873,5,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
9874,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
9875,4,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
9876,5,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
9877,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
9878,3,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
9879,5,Nice phone i am very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
9880,5,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
9881,5,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
9882,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
9883,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
9884,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
9885,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
9886,5,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
9887,5,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
9888,3,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
9889,5,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
9890,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
9891,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
9892,5,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
9893,5,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
9894,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
9895,4,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
9896,5,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
9897,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
9898,3,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
9899,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
9900,5,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
9901,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
9902,5,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
9903,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
9904,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
9905,4,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
9906,5,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
9907,5,Excellent mobile in this price. Battery backup is awesome. Camera is also performing pretty good. Good buy. Value for money. Loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
9908,4,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
9909,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
9910,5,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
9911,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
9912,5,Good but front camera is not good but phone is best all things are suberb only front camera ..
9913,1,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
9914,5,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
9915,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone. Finally i zeroed my search to samsung F11 and Redmi Power: But now I realise that my choice is right about Redmi 9 Power‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Thanks flipkart for one time delivery!!

9916,4,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
9917,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
9918,5,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
9919,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
9920,4,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

9921,4,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
9922,3,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
9923,5,Excellent mobile  Good camera Good design Good battery backup Overall tremendous Mobile I recommend this mobile for low budget customers Thanks flipkart for very good and fair delivery
9924,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
9925,5,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
9926,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

10247,5,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ

Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
10250,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
10251,5,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
10252,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò

10255,5,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
10256,5,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
10257,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
10258,4,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
10259,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
10260,5,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
10261,5,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
10262,5,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
10263,4,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
10264,4,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
10265,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
10266,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
10267,5,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
10268,5,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
10269,3,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
10270,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
10271,5,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
10272,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
10273,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
10274,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
10275,3,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
10276,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
10277,5,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
10278,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
10279,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
10280,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
10281,1,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
10282,5,Excellent mobile in this price. Battery backup is awesome. Camera is also performing pretty good. Good buy. Value for money. Loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10283,4,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
10284,1,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
10285,5,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
10286,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
10287,5,Good but front camera is not good but phone is best all things are suberb only front camera ..
10288,5,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
10289,4,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
10290,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone. Finally i zeroed my search to samsung F11 and Redmi Power: But now I realise that my choice is right about Redmi 9 Power‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Thanks flipkart for one time delivery!! Battery lasts 2~3 days easily with moderate usage!! I am satisfied with my new phone, easily I will recommend my friends as well!!!! Smooth UI, Android 10, Decent Camera, Face unlock, swipe, side finger sensor, IR blaster with MI re..."
10291,5,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
10292,5,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
10293,5,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
10294,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
10295,5,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

10296,1,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
10297,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
10298,5,Excellent mobile  Good camera Good design Good battery backup Overall tremendous Mobile I recommend this mobile for low budget customers Thanks flipkart for very good and fair delivery
10299,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
10300,5,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
10301,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

10819,5,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
10820,5,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
10821,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

10853,5,"Wi fi connection is very poor and slow. Screen brightness is average, set became heated when charging, not upto the mark as value for money."
10854,5,worst camera. Dont buy. Cant go for exchange through flipkart itself.
10855,5,Superb phone in this budget I bought this for my mom and c is happy with the mobile
10856,5,The battery performance is ok but phone is slow in performance and lag oftentimes.
10857,5,"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

11360,5,Product is good. Only one major issue which is observed that it received very weak WiFi signal as compare to other smart phone. The WiFi signal fluctuates very often. VoWiFi calls also gets disconnected many times due to poor WiFi signal reception. The issue is with the model. This has been confirmed from the MI showroom. No one is going to give the replacement for this issue. :( So if you are planning to use it on WiFi maximum time then just go for other option.

12128,2,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."
12129,4,"Highly recommended, the packing was fantastic, macbook feels very rich no doubt and it has its own fluidity, i m having a gr8 experience with this beauty after switching from a windows pc. Awesome product love u mac."
12130,1,"I wanted to buy a laptoo fir mild use which will serve me smoothly for atleast 4-5 years.. im a student and my parents use it just to browse , listen to music , facetime and all those basic things.. i dont about the technical aspects so I'll give a review thats more on the informal side.... The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone ..."
12131,2,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
12132,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
12133,4,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
12134,4,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.  I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks..."
12135,5,"2017 model MacBook Air in 2019 or 2020 ?? Why not..! This is a really fabulous product, Its not about latest model or old model, I believe you need to select product based on your profession and requirements I am an IT programmer and this product fulfils my all requirements. Ever since I switch to Mac from Windows my work gets easy and efficient. The most important factor here is OS, Its superb and way way better than Windows. Tho it has 5th Gen i5 Processor, it is as good as i7 6/7th Gen i..."
12136,3,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
12137,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
12138,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
12139,3,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...
12140,4,"Its a beast that u can't judge without using it. I don't know what have Apple done to this laptop (you can refer it as Black Magic), Best in class performance, no other laptop can beat its speed in this price range and nearer high range laptops. And believe me you can BOAST about your battery amongst ur friends if they don't have this model with them may ot be Macbook or Macbook pro, none of the windows laptop stands anywhere infront of this little miniature beast in case of battery. You own ..."

12142,5,"This is one the best product Iam buying from flipkart thanks for the retailer ""truecomm"" I was worried how will me laptop be. But once I got my product it was fresh and branded. I bought this in big billion day offer for a cheapest price. This MacBook Air apart from everyone's negative view is a great laptop. If you are a gamer go for something else. This looks so good."
12143,1,quite frankly not worth in case you are looking to purchase a business laptop. just wasted my money on this product.  some negatives are mentioned below  1. in case you are extensive user of Excel sheets then this laptop is not for you. As majority of the functions in Excel won't work on this product. I have been told by the apple support to install Windows OS üòÇ instead if I have that kind of work  2. in case you are a gamer don't purchase this product. Processing is not optemized to ensure ...
12144,5,Nice product awsome look and performance as i expected to be But my charger is heating up‚ô®‚ô® very fast As too much that i can't hold it
12145,4,What can I say about this awesome product . Bought this laptop for android dev. Working like pro smoothly running all programs But having some heating issue sometimes feel cpu heating.
12146,3,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it. Anyways got it for 51k in Diwali offer. But even for 62k it is bett...
12147,2,"Wow amazing! what a laptop ,performance is just awesome . Best in value for money. Any cse student can get this, you will not face any software issue even if software is not available in iTunes App Store you can directly google it and download... So I‚Äôll recommend go for itüëç"

12149,5,"I have been using this Laptop from past 5Months and i hope this review will help you decide whether you should get this Laptop in 2021 or not.  1. Performance(4/5) - Macbooks has one best thing that they are very easy to use and they work very smoothly so if you switch from Windows to mac believe me you'll love the experience of Mac environment. This mac does almost every task very smoothly like coding,picture editing or browsing 25apps at the same time or opening 100s of tabs in chrome at on..."
12150,5,Very nice laptop. Easy to use and handle like a book. Different from windows but far better than in functionality. I love it.
12151,5,Go for it even if you are buying it in 2020 or 2021. Review after 3 months. Value for money. Latest MacOS Big Sur works smooth without any trouble. Can be used both for work and personal use seamlessly.
12152,5,"very good performance and nice design of this laptop. It's quite better then windows laptop of this price range speed and processing is fast but display colours are not vibrant but its not that bad too its good for normal works. Internal SSD storage is too less its a major issue with this MacBook, one can bought the 256gb variant but its cost is high and size is also smaller. I am using this from one month and its performance is very impressive and also apple services is top class. One issue..."
12153,4,"Got it on 24th September under big bang sale for just 45k odd bucks. A truly value for money product. Prompt delivery from flip kart. Super fast, amazing look, feather light machine. Well an apple it is. So doesn't need any introduction. I have been a window users since the very beginning so a pleasant change for me."
12154,5,"I bought this in 2018 January for a whooping 44500/- deal. Apple doesn't compromise on their quality on any of their products and specially on their Mac products. Now coming to this Macbook Air A1466, this product is outdated with it's features and you don't get any authentic supplies like screen, Dock or landing zones, etc. from a third party vendor. I have tried buying them from the US as well and I'm out of choice. Hardware still supports the latest of the OS though. I have had trouble wor..."
12155,4,"I read and watched many YouTube video and decided to buy this Macbook Air but in video, Many YouTuber said that the display is not good. but it is good for day to day use. if you are editor of video and pictures, It will be problem to you but you can buy 4k monitor for That. I bought it at 52k. I have ipad pro 9.7. If you want to buy it. Go for it. Save 50k for Ipad pro. This ipad will work as extra monitor for you as well as tablet too. Editing in final cut pro is good but not tried much and..."
12156,1,"I used to make fun of Apple products being over priced and not worth the buy. I'd like to correct it, it is over priced but your spent on it is worth. After using an apple product there is no going back because they are awesome, so think before you buy because your life is going to start becoming expensive üòÇ"
12157,4,Stylish elegant and attractive.  Owsome laptop by Apple and good to use battery life and laptop performance is owsome.  Most owsome part is his trackpad the way Apple think and design the laptop trackpad is owsome.  You can not find it any other laptop.
12158,3,"First Time Using MacBook I switched from windows. MacBook is very easy to use. Its like a mobile operating system. But really very powerful and lightweight. I purchased this MacBook because editing videos and programming. Its very smoothly doing these two works. People were saying about the display that is not great but I did not found anything less into it. Display is great. Everything is great, except memory storage. But because of this every time you need to clean garbage. And you need to ..."
12159,5,This is my first review in Flipkart. My wife gifted me this MacBook air on anniversary. I was worried about the online purchase and authenticity.

For those switching from Windows do go through a Mac tutorials as there are a lot of hidden features which you want to unveil. PROS: Awesome battery..."
12162,4,Best laptop at best price... i got it at 43500 amazing it is :)
12163,1,"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly)."
12164,4,"Better than any windows laptop in this price range.  Perfect laptop for college students. If you are a Web Developer then it's the best laptop for you.  I have bought this laptop for Android & iOS App Development. The performance of this laptop is much more superior than any other windows Laptop.  Android Studio loads up quickly, thanks to the 128 GB SSD. It runs smoothly. There is some heating when we load the Android Emulator. Combined Android Studio & Android Emulator takes about 4GB of Ra..."
12165,5,Works like a Magic. I had doubts before buying ..after a week of using this product I'm totally satisfied with the product. Thanks to seller also for providing the genuine product.
12166,1,"Well it's Apple, so you can't really go wrong with it. Battery definitely lasts for 10 hours. If you're a Windows user, Mac Os will take some getting used to. No Microsoft office, so that's always a downer. But all in all a great laptop. Can't stress how compact and travel friendly it is! Definitely worth the kidney I sold for this haha"
12167,5,"Simply The Best Laptop If U can Get It Under 50K. Most recommended for Law students and frequent travelers amazing speakers amazing speed the display doesn't feel bad if u. are upgrading from 30-40 k laptop but if u are coming down from higher specced PC or Laptop then only u can find the difference because of the smaller screen, the PPI is great so every content looks great I got it for 42K at Big.

12176,5,"Superb machine for entry level computing. Unless you are too much obsessed with Windows OS, it is time to shift to MAC OS and it works great. Yes you can not run pirated softwares on Mac. But it is worth a try."
12177,2,"What can I say?? Its a beautiful piece just built amazingly. Love the track pad which is so soft and even though the screen is small and old, its worth every penny. Just buy it."
12178,5,"First time Mac users please read this. Best at this Price Point, even if it is increased from 55000 to 65000 within an year but still good. Yes when you are setting up your Mac please press on the trackpad because if you just click then it will not work you can change that to touch after setting up your Mac after going to settings. I use this Mac for all of my work like UI & UX Designing, 2D & 3D Animation, 3D modeling in blender, Video Editing etc. And it works great. You will find a bit he..."

12193,5,"Great product even today! I brought this on june 2020. Performance is awesome, and ofcourse the interface is lovable, and above my expectations it handles MATLAB, and other IDE pretty well.Overall 5 star for product and for flipkart also for fast delivery."
12194,4,"Before buying Macbook, first anaylse your requiremnets. If you want a descent laptop with highest battery backup and which can be easily portable and you don't want it for gaming purpose. Then I must recommend you for the Macbook Air. The 2017 model which I have purchased performs well even when many apps are simultaneously open. Also if you are switching from windows to mac, then you will see the vast differences and you will love it. In short its a perfect laptop for general task such as do..."
12195,5,"first time Mac user, performance wise far better than my old window laptop,look should be improved wrt the bezel rest are good. battery backup mentioned around 12 hour but it's around 8 hour with normal usage which is fine I guess. good for people who want to use premium laptop within reasonable budget."
12196,4,"It is perfect in all ways if anybody want any laptop. Then it is the best because it, itself inspire us to work"
12197,5,"Excellent system for middle class developers. I am a freelancer / mobile developer, I need both android studio and xcode. This system is enough to work with both platforms. Nice packing and delivery by flipkart."
12198,5,thak you apple for such wonderful product with such satisfying price and excellent performance. thanks to flipkart too for too good services. worth buying.
12199,5,Wow the best laptop I have ever used!! It is an excellent piece of work done by apple. Mac os is simply the best os in the world. Once a Mac user always a Mac user.
12200,4,Apple..The name is enough to describe it's experience. it's awesome ... Very slim and smooth surface. just in love with it.
12201,4,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.
12202,5,"Awesome product at such great price. On Flipkart got it with gud price tag, as compared to market with complete authenticity of product by Flipkart. Nicely packed and delivered by special delivery process by Flipkart.Purchased on 3 Sept and got delivered on 4 sept, Great delivery process by Flipkart."
12203,5,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"
12204,4,"worth every Penny!  Apple ! Till now I used to work on Windows but after MacBook my views are completely change about apple products and seriously I love my MacBook, the way it's working never stuck no complain , lightening fast , hazel free charging problem and led backlit keyboard and last but not the least it's design, the features , security and operating system attracts me to work.  and I never get bored to working on it .

12205,4,"Bought it during BBD at around 43.5k,. First of all I would like to thank Flipkart for such a cheap bargain and quick delivery! Coming to laptop most of us know Mac OS is beast, Build quality is awesome and i5 processor is working so smooth like butter for daily tasks!"
12206,5,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
12207,3,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
12208,5,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
12209,5,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
12210,5,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
12211,3,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
12212,5,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
12213,4,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !
12214,1,"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup."
12215,4,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
12216,5,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
12217,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
12218,5,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
12219,3,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"
12220,1,"Hello,  Here is my Review after 10 days of purchase  Pro : 1.Smoothness 2.Superb battery backup 3. No hang, no lagging 4. After sell support from apple just wow 5. smooth for photoshop  Cons: 1. Charger problem, Overheated (May be in my case Only) 2. For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
12221,5,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1. Four Google Chrome Tabs 2. Three excel sheets 3. Two Word documents. 4. Microsoft Teams 5. Netflix 6. Youtube  I have not been able to find any performance issues so far. The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...
12222,5,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
12223,3,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"
12224,2,"Good product for software developer .when i used this laptop for web development and software development like python and its library its quite good for that.it also good for simple deep learning model creations and data science project . storage is less . its fast compare to windows i5, its smooth compare to windows any machines . but when i used this laptop for virtual machine it is not quite good for that bcz of less storage and i5 processor .when u used this laptop for virtual machine bat..."
12225,5,"I am fully satisfied with this Apple laptop in this price range. Its 2019 manufacturing with original software, excellent battery backup. Thanks to Flipkart & waiting for more offers like this."
12226,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).  Cons: If you are planning to play games....this is not for you, this is a..."
12227,5,"- using for coding and Xcode work well in this - space is little less , we take back in 2 months - design is great - 2017 model we get and registered into apple support website - great for browsing - for photoshop designing not so good"
12228,5,"If you are looking at a laptop with good performance and good battery life and want to do programming this laptop is for you. There are some pros and cons in this laptop.  Pros : 1. The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3. Battery life is good it gives 6-8 hours of battery backup 4. Keypad is very lite and doesn't make soun..."
12229,4,"awesomeness is the word. awesome speed, awesome battery, awesome multi tasking, awesome (light) weight, awesome touch pad (no use of mouse reqd)"
12230,1,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
12231,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
12232,1,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
12233,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
12234,5,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
12235,4,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
12236,3,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
12237,4,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
12238,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
12239,1,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
12240,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
12241,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
12242,2,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind. It's worth every penny your are paying. Everyone know the pros, the only con is screen. But trust me guys display is still awesome. It gives immense pleasure to work on Mac. It's must buy unless you are a gamer."
12243,5,"I got it at 49K, I was planning to buy one from Inspire at 60K. Got it at best possible price, in best possible packing and it got delivered within 3 days from the day I placed an order.  Thanks to Flipkart - Best e-commerce product in India."

Pros Nearly no virus problem Starts very fast Looks so premium and out of the league. Light weight... Conclusion is hardware n build quality is best no point of comparison.  Cons for Windows user Mac OS. Not so user friendly. When u stuck on something u have to do it using script on command prompt linux based.  No HDD only SSD of 128gb No CD Rom N...

Bought it on big billion day offer.Its my first Apple product.Its easier than Windows as per me.It has a very classy look and sturdy built quality.Its very light compared to other laptops.The display is bit low,but we have to sacrifice atleast one to this stunning device.Finally I loved this superb product from Apple and lots of thanks to Flipkart for its good packaging service.Obviously I must rate this product 5‚≠ê."

12247,4,Best
12248,4,"I have been using macbook pro since 2 year. Now on flipkart exchanged with this macbook air at first glance it's pretty good looking device, thin, very light, attractive. Performance is good. Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
12249,5,it's just a nice product
12250,5,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.
12251,5,When open the flap and start it you get the feel of this big package come in small size and elegant design . Finest creation of apple is helping out people to give an unprecedented experience of finesse quality speed performance and user friendly interface alongwith beautiful ergonomic design . Hats off
12252,3,"User friendly, nice design. using it for web development (PHP laravel JavaScript reactjs...) and working beautifully. great product for general use (surfing, movies, office...), not for gaming."

12255,1,It's is quite good n really amazing at 45k budget I love this product but delivery is very late. Battery backup is super very slim n well design n compacted
12256,5,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
12257,1,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
12258,3,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
12259,5,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

ALso the delivery person just ran away without even taking my signature. this is a security flaw , how do we know that packet was handed over to customer. if delivery boys are signing delivery receipt themsleves then it is a big issue. thankfully -I have reveived a genuine August 2018 imported MacBook.

Cons: 1) Battery last only 10 hours on heavy usag..."
12269,5,The product received was well packed and safe. The best part was it was Sept 2019 imported so not that old piece. I basically am not a very heavy user of laptops. Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
12270,1,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
12271,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

12293,5,"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products.

12300,1,Awesome product by apple. I purchased it from big billion day sale. I was waiting for this since last year. Product delivered to me early and in good packaging. So i am happy and satisfied.
12301,4,"I got a faulty product. The delivery was fantastic. Packaging was perfect and the experience of a mac was superb. However, the usb ports do not work for me which is a disappointment. I will now need to carry it to a service centre or apple store and get it replaced. I noticed it a couple days later since I didn‚Äôt try usb. So, this makes my experience a little bitter. Nevertheless good job with the delivery flipkart. Appreciate"

12319,4,"simply. the best laptop. using it for general purpose as well as python programming. has been a delight so far with quick battery charge. ease of use ,sleek looks and amazing performance"
12320,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
12321,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"
12322,5,Best for Travel.....very Handy and stylish.... best battery life .... last nearly for 10 to 12 hrs for normal use....
12323,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
12324,4,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."
12325,5,I Love Apple Products it is perfect match for my old I phone 5s and redmi note 4 this is awesome slick laptop and very beautiful

12330,5,"absolutely awesome and ideal laptop for any college student ( except civil , mechanical engineer and architect as you guys should go for MacBook Pro as you will require extreme computing power for your designing projects) due to the fact that despite being bit underpowered on paper the permonance is as good as any windows laptop of 16 gb RAM and 8th generation i5 processor. Unless you are a hardcore gamer and can not afford the price, DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER LAPTOP other than MacBook Air if you ..."

Android studio and xcode runs smoothly without lag. Even emulator of Android studio runs very smoothly. 5. Mag safe port is really good thing.  cons:- 1. Its i5 5th gen which is very old. 2. Display is small but that cannot be considered as cons.  if all pros are there then why just 3 üåü? Because I feel my device is defe...
12336,5,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product. But hey, Apple is really good at giving you a Year of Warranty despite you buy it through an Apple Retailer/Reseller or through an online Reseller like Flipkart does. Though the latter one give..."

12349,4,First time purchaser of an apple product. MacBook is an excellent laptop. No matching no comparisons with its counterparts. Very powerful machine can do most of ur task easily. Well aluminium built body but very light to carry anywhere. Performance is excellent. Battery backup is also very gud . With my first charge I used it for a week. Very satisfied with the product. Apple product standards are unmatched in the market.
12350,5,"Very Efficient Device. Apple devices have strong integration between hardware and software hence even with lower specs on paper, it outperform windows running hardware. This Mac is good enough for daily activity, running programming IDE, emulators etc. Not meant for heavy duty gaming, but 8gb of RAM can handle moderate gaming as well. Most Amazing feature is battery life, unparalleled even when compared to macbook pro. I get 10+ hrs on moderate usage on single charge. Was a steal at 45k, a we..."

Hard disk only 128 GB But these cons are not that sig...
12355,5,Happy with the product & packing was good .  if ur looking for a Sleek and portable laptop with efficient battery then this one is a good pick. Display though is a bit on the lower side unlike the Apple retina display.  Also consider that the laptop doesnt have any lan port or hdmi port.we need to separately purchase the thunderbolt2 converters.The actual apple prices are proced above 1500 bucks.   Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.

To be frank I was worried upon the negative review of this lap top where people have mentioned about heck a lot of complaints on the product build quality and performance. But after using my received item, I feel much satisfied not the laptop. It is just like handling a mobile but in the form of a lap top and very addicti..."
12431,5,Perfectly designed for business travelling people.
12432,5,if you are really serious about display quality then it is quite disappointed for me when i first open and expected a good display .. if you have budget go for retina display
12433,1,Excellent.
12434,5,"amazing build quality, and the screen is not bad, you can increase brightness significantly. I have upgraded from 720p screen and it's around 1080p(not exactly). great product, though slow delivery from flipkart took 9 days.."
12435,5,Genuine product love it
12436,5,"If you love the iOS environment, want superb connectivity with your iPhone, this laptop is the best deal out there. Of course if you have the bucks, the other mac models are awesome too. The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."
12437,1,Good product with this price 56k
12438,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
12439,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...
12440,1,"Worth the penny... I was afraid about the online purchase, but Flipkart didn't made me down. It was all perfect and the MacBook Air- an awesome product by Apple. I love it"

12443,1,Nice product
12444,5,Awesome product ...great...
12445,5,"At 45k pricepoint its the best. Lightweight as name suggests. Ssd quickly opens everything Short on storage (purchase an external hard disk or jetdrive or something like it) Battery backup the best off all laptops, more than 12hrs of backup working on docs and listening songs. Magsafe charges even quickly. Less ports so separate adapters are must Overall bestbuy at this pricepoint"

It would have been just WOW if delivery was within 24 hrs of reaching the city.  The packing was very good and its import date is of Aug 2017. The os got upgraded to high sierra on updation.

12449,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac. But believe me it's not that difficult. I had few issues in the beginning but you can always Google it and find the solution. Also Flipkart did the good job of delivering it as per promised.

I hope it will not disappoint you if you are thinking buying it. kindly do check about latest model as well. This is 2017 model though you can go with this as it has all the regular updates which Apple provides.
12467,1,It is as amazing as a laptop can be. Buy it for daily use and work purpose. Gaming is not possible. Battery life is phenomenal. Works like a charm and is a 2017 edition. Great buy. Received on time and with great exchange offer.

12470,1,A great product from Apple. I bought it just to give it a try to Mac and now I am never going back to windows ever. Soon I will need a pro version though. The specifications are on a lower side but the experience is so good. Worth every penny.  received a cashback of 10500. Great deal

12487,5,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
12488,5,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.
12489,2,"Thanks Flipkart, Good time delivery. Another apple brand so classic ,so elegant and beautiful. all rumours with this are just wastefull. awesome build quality, look , screen ,work absolutely flowless.  switching myself from window to macbook. Great product by apple at such price. five star."
12490,4,"A very nice laptop but is overpriced.The maintenance is too damn high.I bough this in 2018 and in 2 years this laptop broke down two times,both during june july month.The service centre told it's a common problem with macbook air.The first time it crashed it was still in warranty period and hence was repaired for free. But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y..."
12491,5,"Macbook air as a product is undoubtedly great. however a word of caution regarding the seller. Not a reliable seller. i bought it from Truecom retail and was sold by sane retails pvt ltd from telangana. when i checked the serial number of the macbook for warranty status on apple website, it showed purchase date not validated and serial number was not mentioned in the invoice. hence it was not showing 1 yr warranty. I contacted flipkart for resolving the issue and i was promised that issue wou..."

12506,5,A premium quality product... aluminium built...light weight... outstanding battery performance...amazing window transition optimizations...it is currently running on Mojave V10.14.4...but it has recieved an update to 10.14.6

12509,5,"light , fast and easy to handle, good purchase"
12510,5,"No comparison with any other laptop for any task. Best machine for coding, graphic designing and business use. But, If you need a laptop for professional video editing and can spend some more money, Go for Macbook PRO..! Otherwise MacBook Air is best laptop and value for money"
12511,4,Very good
12512,5,"I am a software developer, It works fine for me."
12513,5,Suffering to adapt the iOS system while whole life spent using windows.

12515,5,"Its Mac so no need to tell anything about the product. But I must tell about Flipkart. delivery was fast, nicely packed. after two months all of a sudden my mac charger stop working, may be my bad luck. I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
12516,4,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...
12517,5,"First of all thanks to flipkart for big billion day and quick delivery. Got the product for 43500/-, one of the best deal.  No doubt that machine performs well. No heating issues and quite easy to carry around. Good battery backup as well. If may feel a bit of difficulty in using the machine initially is you are from a windows world. But it just takes few hours to familiarize and then you will enjoy the ride"
12518,5,This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...
12519,5,Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free. Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.

I have a macmini at my disposal so i was aware of the fluency mac os has. battery backup is awesome, it definitely will last for more then 8+ hours on single charge.

Display was not working but my good luck that it was still in warrenty and thus they have replaced motherboard and it started working again and after exactly one year I'm facing same issue but this time they told me that I need to replace the motherboard which coast me 42000.  I suggest not to buy this laptop.
12541,4,"I've purchased this laptop for 45k during big billion day sale and I was lucky to get it at that unbelievable price. Talking about the laptop, in 2018 it is outdated with the hardware and the design but still, it is the best buy if you got this 3 major aspects before going for a laptop : 1) Long battery life 2) Light Weight 3) Versatile Then go for it without thinking about anything else. Yeah, it is not for the gamers. I use it regularly for coding, web and movies and it is doing pretty awes..."

12571,3,"I was a skeptic regarding Mac. Why is it so costly? Turns out, you get exactly what you pay for. A premium looking laptop with great quality and battery life. After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."
12572,1,"I have used all Apple products and my experience is quite satisfactory. But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."

12580,3,I am posting this 1 star not for the laptop but for Flipkart..They keep exchange offer and expect that customers will give them a brand new product in return.The pick up guy comes and cancels for scratches
12581,3,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
12582,4,Cool üòéüòé nice product
12583,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
12584,5,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
12585,5,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
12586,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
12587,5,It work slow

When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
12589,5,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
12590,3,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
12591,1,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
12592,5,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
12593,1,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
12594,3,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
12595,4,"Good service , good product, Happy with Purchase..."
12596,4,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
12597,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."
12598,5,I am using it for 3 years. So far the best experience with Apple.
12599,5,I agrer that not all with believe... but after one year you will face issue while turning the PC ON...U go to Apple Store and you willl find 5-6 persons around u complaining samr thing.. Better have another option
12600,5,I love mac book

12604,2,"Me the first time Apple Mac user. It is so stylish and with premium finish. Just started using this machine, it is way ahead of windows machine although it will take bit of time to get used to with working of mac os. Definately recommended."
12605,3,If you want performance only go for it... Good for programmers
12606,5,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"
12607,4,"Perhaps my biggest purchase online, thank u Flipkart for the offer on the product, speed is lighting fast and needless to talk much about apple which is world acclaimed. Happy to have bought the product and serves my purpose of drafting on the go"
12608,4,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
12609,1,so good
12610,4,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
12611,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class

12619,3,"When this laptop was not there I used many laptops like Dell, Lenovo, hp, etc. But after using this one the world has a change of mine, I am learning something new day by day. One thing I want to tell you that the Windows OS is just one type of box in front of the Mac."
12620,4,Best laptop ever for students using it from last 2 years and it still feels like new. amazing performance and battery life.
12621,5,If you wanna buy laptop and you budget is 60k then go for it

12642,5,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

12651,1,Highly recommended for College Students.
12652,1,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."
12653,2,"I purchased this on oct 2018. From that time I got 3 times issue. Now it is out of warranty and costing of repairing is 49,000/-. I am not happy with the product. Really very disappointed."
12654,5,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future
12655,4,"Came in good packaging , was happy with the delivery and checked the serial number, and found original. Then after 3 days , not even used and the keys are loose and started falling off ! Frustrating ! Paid a huge amount and the build quality is pathetic ! It‚Äôs in service Center !!!"

12664,3,"don't buy MacBook online, keyboard not working ,not repairable only replaceable"
12665,1,"I was a bit confused about this laptop as it is my first laptop. I didn't want regretful purchase.

12711,4,No doubt it's an amazing product. But the laptop started switching off without power on. Then I had to goto the service enter and they found the connection to the battery inside the laptop was loose and hence it was not charging. Didn't expect this from an apple product.

12765,2,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
12766,2,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

12792,1,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
12793,2,Awesome
12794,2,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
12795,2,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!

12797,5,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
12798,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
12799,4,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

12832,1,Good
12833,1,Really ‚Äì not to doubt on Apple . It is really a good product for studying purpose . If you can afford the price different of approx 10k to 12 k then it will really be a good choice.
12834,1,amzing laotop with best design and light weight... osam battery backup..
12835,5,thankyou flipkart for such great deal.
12836,5,Really I like this product. Nice battery backup and totally different from windows.
12837,5,"No words to describe, loved the product."
12838,4,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
12839,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
12840,2,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."
12841,5,"Works flawlessly, I mainly use it for software development üëç"
12842,4,I have been using it for about 6 mo. The battery life on this thing is amazing! Just gets the job done!
12843,1,awsm..........
12844,5,Simply Awesome
12845,1,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
12846,2,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.
12847,5,Excellent packing by Flipkart.Product is so so good.I love it
12848,5,Very nice product
12849,1,Apple products have no compromise in quality.
12850,3,This is asome product. If any one bujet 50 k those person plz take it.

12853,4,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
12854,4,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
12855,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
12856,3,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!
12857,5,"Got it for 43k from sale. And It has all , what you expect from a macbook."
12858,1,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."

12864,4,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
12865,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
12866,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
12867,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
12868,5,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.
12869,4,This is the newer version with latest 2017 Sierra OS. It comes with 8GB ram. 10 hours battery life on full charge. full aluminum body.  Go for it.
12870,4,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
12871,2,Impressive!!!
12872,5,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
12873,1,Who else got it for 38K :D
12874,5,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
12875,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
12876,3,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
12877,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
12878,5,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
12879,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
12880,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
12881,3,nice product.fast deliver....love it
12882,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
12883,5,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
12884,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
12885,2,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
12886,1,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
12887,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
12888,5,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
12889,5,nice prodect
12890,4,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
12891,5,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
12892,2,Good product but price varies
12893,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
12894,3,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
12895,1,Great
12896,5,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
12897,1,Amazing quality
12898,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
12899,4,Very nice products.
12900,3,Good but price high
12901,2,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
12902,5,Perfect
12903,2,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
12904,5,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
12905,4,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
12906,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
12907,3,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
12908,5,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
12909,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
12910,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
12911,2,charget not found
12912,2,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
12913,4,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
12914,5,I think window is better system Crashes
12915,1,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
12916,4,Very nice product apple MacBook air
12917,5,Superb product
12918,3,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
12919,5,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
12920,1,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
12921,5,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
12922,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
12923,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
12924,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
12925,1,Stunningly superb
12926,4,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
12927,4,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
12928,3,bettery performance not upto the mark
12929,4,It's a good product but not value for money
12930,5,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
12931,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
12932,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
12933,3,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
12934,5,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
12935,1,not good quality
12936,4,awesome product saves lot of time
12937,5,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
12938,5,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
12939,5,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

12947,5,Best laptop in 48k...
12948,4,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

12974,5,"Never trust flipkart for these products. After 5 months of the purchase my laptop's motherboard is damaged without any reason at all. The charge doesn't stay even for 5 hours. I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

12978,4,Awesome product Really superior Mac Book in all branded laptop
12979,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

12993,1,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

13023,3,Just Amazing

13025,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
13026,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
13027,5,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
13028,1,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

13073,4,Display viewing angle is very bad. 10 Hours battery backup is not true. Only 6-7 hour battery backup. I'm using only browser & documents work.  Apart from this.. Good laptop for day to day usage.  THE BEST mouse trackpad. Great keyboard.
13074,4,Just Wow
13075,4,Got it delivered at 16th Nov 2020 After 2 week of usage I am writing the review.. Design is good. Its far far better than windows PC of 16gb RAM. Very elegance.  Pros High performance Good for programming Video quality is good.  Cons Compatibility issues for long windows user which can be solved with continuous practice.  Overall I am pretty happy with the product.

13080,5,Okay
13081,4,"Superb laptop.. Writing review after using a laptop for 7 days. In terms of performance, this is the best laptop u can get in this price range. For coding and business purpose this is a powerful machine. Video editing up to HD can be done easily but 1080p,4k is not preferable on this laptop. Not suitable for games."

13092,3,Got damaged product
13093,4,"It's awesome heating should be resolve, otherwise all is well"
13094,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

13229,4,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."

13253,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app). Literally, I am getting 12 hours of battery. There is no issue of heating...."

13292,1,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.

This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."

This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
13329,5,Amazing
13330,4,Good perched
13331,4,One if the best purchase
13332,1,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
13333,5,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
13334,5,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display
13335,1,"Suprb Quality As expected.. Nice packaging.. Sexy design.. In case of OS ,For programmers and coders I think the bestest ever laptop I have been using .. Love uh Mac and Flipkart also for giving me a genuine product. Thanks a lot..."

13342,5,"Having purchased the Mac Book Air, my friend asked me how it is and I just replied with a single word - ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù  That having said, I read above reviews already given and everything about the Mac book Air looks good and many have said that the display could be better but I personally am satisfied with this MacBook. The model is 2017 which misses the fingerprint and Retina display from 2018 model. Pretty decent for android studio for mobile app development. The power on time is impressively lo..."
13343,4,Battery was awesome.. Performance management was really good. Note* Not for gamers.. Rest go blindly...
13344,5,Good laptop. I got it for 56k worth it. Display is not great. You can buy lifetime subscription of office at 2000 for those who are worried about office.
13345,5,I have purchased the product but the screen gets off in between automatically and also when i touch the screen it gives electric shock sometimes
13346,5,Awesome
13347,5,I received this macbook air yesterday. This review based on first day use of macbook air: Pros: Battery I think 8 hours to 10 hours working once fully charged 2)Very Fast charging 3) Apple customer support is good 4) Proceeser Fast working 5) Light weight 6) Sound is good Cons: 1) Display is average Suggestions: Very good os
13348,5,If u are comparing it with windows by looking at its specs just don't ...if u are getting it below 60k just go for it.and the display it is not bad at allll....battery is great...performance is great but no gaming on this machine*****video edting is smooth like very very smooth except 4k it does the job thoough...

13397,5,"I was sceptical about buying a macbook first, but I never regretted buying one. If you are in a dilemma whether to go do this or another option. Just go for this."
13398,3,Light as a notebook. Great battery life. Superb performance.
13399,3,Wonderful product by apple sure to sugest other
13400,5,I brought it to study reactjs and do some web development it‚Äôs working good as of now
13401,4,Good quality
13402,4,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
13403,5,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
13404,2,Nice product
13405,5,Very very bad display looks are excellent performance is excellent battery life and so too good but this place I have ever seen in this price range

13408,4,Super as thin as air
13409,5,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
13410,2,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
13411,4,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
13412,3,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
13413,5,Worthy of money
13414,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
13415,3,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
13416,1,Fall in love with this
13417,4,Good
13418,3,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
13419,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
13420,3,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
13421,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
13422,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
13423,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
13424,5,Nice product
13425,3,"Great product, my daughter love it."

13430,4,Worth
13431,1,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
13432,4,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
13433,5,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
13434,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
13435,3,Good
13436,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
13437,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
13438,2,good
13439,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
13440,1,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
13441,4,Macbook air is awesome.
13442,4,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
13443,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
13444,5,Best
13445,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
13446,1,Very good...it is mind-blowing
13447,4,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
13448,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
13449,5,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
13450,4,Good
13451,3,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
13452,1,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
13453,2,Great product. Just loving it.
13454,1,Nice
13455,3,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
13456,5,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
13457,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
13458,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
13459,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
13460,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
13461,3,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
13462,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
13463,5,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
13464,5,Very good
13465,5,Good Product.
13466,5,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
13467,5,Beautiful
13468,3,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
13469,4,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
13470,5,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
13471,5,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
13472,5,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

13515,4,A wonderful product.
13516,4,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
13517,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
13518,4,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
13519,5,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
13520,4,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
13521,4,Great laptop even in 2020
13522,4,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

13694,3,Great experience.
13695,2,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
13696,1,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy
13697,5,Worth of money
13698,5,it is best for carrying. battery is good
13699,5,good product at great price

13719,3,what can be better
13720,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
13721,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
13722,4,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
13723,5,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
13724,4,Value for money.

14418,5,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.

14420,5,High performance laptop
14421,5,Macbook Air is working fine.

And the most amazing feature is trackpad, one can do anything and everything with such trackpad. Mac is for all the users who wish their computer work flowless and respond when they wanted it to be.

14718,3,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."
14719,5,"Highly recommended, the packing was fantastic, macbook feels very rich no doubt and it has its own fluidity, i m having a gr8 experience with this beauty after switching from a windows pc. Awesome product love u mac."
14720,3,"I wanted to buy a laptoo fir mild use which will serve me smoothly for atleast 4-5 years.. im a student and my parents use it just to browse , listen to music , facetime and all those basic things.. i dont about the technical aspects so I'll give a review thats more on the informal side.... The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone ..."
14721,4,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
14722,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
14723,1,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
14724,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.  I'm a software engineer and I have a company issued MacBook Pro 15"" late 2016, I wanted a MacBook which I could use for my personal tasks..."
14725,4,"2017 model MacBook Air in 2019 or 2020 ?? Why not..! This is a really fabulous product, Its not about latest model or old model, I believe you need to select product based on your profession and requirements I am an IT programmer and this product fulfils my all requirements. Ever since I switch to Mac from Windows my work gets easy and efficient. The most important factor here is OS, Its superb and way way better than Windows. Tho it has 5th Gen i5 Processor, it is as good as i7 6/7th Gen i..."
14726,5,I used to actually for 1 year and after that i am writing this review... I bought it in sept 2019 BBD for 49000/- Rs on sale and for me it is like a very good product.. I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
14727,3,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
14728,3,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
14729,4,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...
14730,5,"Its a beast that u can't judge without using it. I don't know what have Apple done to this laptop (you can refer it as Black Magic), Best in class performance, no other laptop can beat its speed in this price range and nearer high range laptops. And believe me you can BOAST about your battery amongst ur friends if they don't have this model with them may ot be Macbook or Macbook pro, none of the windows laptop stands anywhere infront of this little miniature beast in case of battery. You own ..."
14731,5,"who can complain about apple, it is a wonderful piece . sound quality is mind-blowing , never expected that much actually . camera is decent enough and the build up is awesome"
14732,4,"This is one the best product Iam buying from flipkart thanks for the retailer ""truecomm"" I was worried how will me laptop be. But once I got my product it was fresh and branded. I bought this in big billion day offer for a cheapest price. This MacBook Air apart from everyone's negative view is a great laptop. If you are a gamer go for something else. This looks so good."
14733,4,quite frankly not worth in case you are looking to purchase a business laptop. just wasted my money on this product.  some negatives are mentioned below  1. in case you are extensive user of Excel sheets then this laptop is not for you. As majority of the functions in Excel won't work on this product. I have been told by the apple support to install Windows OS üòÇ instead if I have that kind of work  2. in case you are a gamer don't purchase this product. Processing is not optemized to ensure ...
14734,5,Nice product awsome look and performance as i expected to be But my charger is heating up‚ô®‚ô® very fast As too much that i can't hold it
14735,4,What can I say about this awesome product . Bought this laptop for android dev. Working like pro smoothly running all programs But having some heating issue sometimes feel cpu heating.
14736,4,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it. Anyways got it for 51k in Diwali offer. But even for 62k it is bett...
14737,1,"Wow amazing! what a laptop ,performance is just awesome . Best in value for money. Any cse student can get this, you will not face any software issue even if software is not available in iTunes App Store you can directly google it and download... So I‚Äôll recommend go for itüëç"
14738,4,"Terrific deal, I got it just for ‚Çπ49k. the design is beautiful works perfectly battery is also good enough and charges very fast, updated with Macos Mojave and became a little slow while turning on. display should have been better."
14739,4,"I have been using this Laptop from past 5Months and i hope this review will help you decide whether you should get this Laptop in 2021 or not.  1. Performance(4/5) - Macbooks has one best thing that they are very easy to use and they work very smoothly so if you switch from Windows to mac believe me you'll love the experience of Mac environment. This mac does almost every task very smoothly like coding,picture editing or browsing 25apps at the same time or opening 100s of tabs in chrome at on..."
14740,3,Very nice laptop. Easy to use and handle like a book. Different from windows but far better than in functionality. I love it.
14741,5,Go for it even if you are buying it in 2020 or 2021. Review after 3 months. Value for money. Latest MacOS Big Sur works smooth without any trouble. Can be used both for work and personal use seamlessly.
14742,5,"very good performance and nice design of this laptop. It's quite better then windows laptop of this price range speed and processing is fast but display colours are not vibrant but its not that bad too its good for normal works. Internal SSD storage is too less its a major issue with this MacBook, one can bought the 256gb variant but its cost is high and size is also smaller. I am using this from one month and its performance is very impressive and also apple services is top class. One issue..."
14743,4,"Got it on 24th September under big bang sale for just 45k odd bucks. A truly value for money product. Prompt delivery from flip kart. Super fast, amazing look, feather light machine. Well an apple it is. So doesn't need any introduction. I have been a window users since the very beginning so a pleasant change for me."
14744,3,"I bought this in 2018 January for a whooping 44500/- deal. Apple doesn't compromise on their quality on any of their products and specially on their Mac products. Now coming to this Macbook Air A1466, this product is outdated with it's features and you don't get any authentic supplies like screen, Dock or landing zones, etc. from a third party vendor. I have tried buying them from the US as well and I'm out of choice. Hardware still supports the latest of the OS though. I have had trouble wor..."
14745,5,"I read and watched many YouTube video and decided to buy this Macbook Air but in video, Many YouTuber said that the display is not good. but it is good for day to day use. if you are editor of video and pictures, It will be problem to you but you can buy 4k monitor for That. I bought it at 52k. I have ipad pro 9.7. If you want to buy it. Go for it. Save 50k for Ipad pro. This ipad will work as extra monitor for you as well as tablet too. Editing in final cut pro is good but not tried much and..."
14746,2,"I used to make fun of Apple products being over priced and not worth the buy. I'd like to correct it, it is over priced but your spent on it is worth. After using an apple product there is no going back because they are awesome, so think before you buy because your life is going to start becoming expensive üòÇ"
14747,3,Stylish elegant and attractive.  Owsome laptop by Apple and good to use battery life and laptop performance is owsome.  Most owsome part is his trackpad the way Apple think and design the laptop trackpad is owsome.  You can not find it any other laptop.
14748,5,"First Time Using MacBook I switched from windows. MacBook is very easy to use. Its like a mobile operating system. But really very powerful and lightweight. I purchased this MacBook because editing videos and programming. Its very smoothly doing these two works. People were saying about the display that is not great but I did not found anything less into it. Display is great. Everything is great, except memory storage. But because of this every time you need to clean garbage. And you need to ..."
14749,4,This is my first review in Flipkart. My wife gifted me this MacBook air on anniversary. I was worried about the online purchase and authenticity. But I would like to assure you that I have received 100 percent original product. I have checked the serial number online. The packaging was perfect. I have received the laptop on 23.01.2020. till now it's well and good. Battery is awesome I am getting at least 10 hours in a single charge. My usage are mainly official and YouTube video watching.

For those switching from Windows do go through a Mac tutorials as there are a lot of hidden features which you want to unveil. PROS: Awesome battery..."
14752,5,Best laptop at best price... i got it at 43500 amazing it is :)
14753,1,"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly)."
14754,4,"Better than any windows laptop in this price range.  Perfect laptop for college students. If you are a Web Developer then it's the best laptop for you.  I have bought this laptop for Android & iOS App Development. The performance of this laptop is much more superior than any other windows Laptop.  Android Studio loads up quickly, thanks to the 128 GB SSD. It runs smoothly. There is some heating when we load the Android Emulator. Combined Android Studio & Android Emulator takes about 4GB of Ra..."
14755,4,Works like a Magic. I had doubts before buying ..after a week of using this product I'm totally satisfied with the product. Thanks to seller also for providing the genuine product.
14756,5,"Well it's Apple, so you can't really go wrong with it. Battery definitely lasts for 10 hours. If you're a Windows user, Mac Os will take some getting used to. No Microsoft office, so that's always a downer. But all in all a great laptop. Can't stress how compact and travel friendly it is! Definitely worth the kidney I sold for this haha"
14757,5,"Simply The Best Laptop If U can Get It Under 50K. Most recommended for Law students and frequent travelers amazing speakers amazing speed the display doesn't feel bad if u. are upgrading from 30-40 k laptop but if u are coming down from higher specced PC or Laptop then only u can find the difference because of the smaller screen, the PPI is great so every content looks great I got it for 42K at Big.

Got this product at 45k, and having chosen the 'No cost EMI' that was available, it was an effortless purchase. One that I'm really glad of. The build quality is excellent, nothing that is offered by the counterparts running windows at this price. The OS is very beautiful, you can easily fall in love with it. And I can't say anything that ..."

14765,4,Great Product. Delivered in proper packing and Delivery boy was very supportive and helpful
14766,1,"Superb machine for entry level computing. Unless you are too much obsessed with Windows OS, it is time to shift to MAC OS and it works great. Yes you can not run pirated softwares on Mac. But it is worth a try."
14767,2,"What can I say?? Its a beautiful piece just built amazingly. Love the track pad which is so soft and even though the screen is small and old, its worth every penny. Just buy it."
14768,5,"First time Mac users please read this. Best at this Price Point, even if it is increased from 55000 to 65000 within an year but still good. Yes when you are setting up your Mac please press on the trackpad because if you just click then it will not work you can change that to touch after setting up your Mac after going to settings. I use this Mac for all of my work like UI & UX Designing, 2D & 3D Animation, 3D modeling in blender, Video Editing etc. And it works great. You will find a bit he..."

And for those concerned about quality of screen, I will say it is far better than what reviewers here say. I mean I have worked on 15k laptop, a FHD laptop (my last one) and many others one. Even though pixel wise the display is a tad lower than FHD screen but nowhere bad like those windows HD screen. I love it. Other t..."

14779,5,"I have used all company laptops, dell, Sony vaio, hp, Lenovo etc . This is the best. Great quality and smooth buttery performance. Don‚Äôt go by the specs. Apple always integrates software and hardware better than other company in the world.  Con: the operating system needs some time to get adjusted to. But once you learn it - you will be enjoying a fantastic experience."
14780,4,"apple macbook air mid 2017 is well known compact business machine. It weighs around 1.65 kg. It comes with Sierra mac os, upgradable with Mojave mac os. It has 128 GB of solid state ssd and 8 GB of ram. processor is it dual core 1.8 ghz. Body made of aluminium unibody. Keyboard is fine but unlike macbook pro, keys are made of polymer.

14782,5,"I was using windows based laptops for many years now...things were okay till the time i bought ASUS laptop E203NAH in 2018 which made my life miserable and thats how i thought of moving out of windows based laptops.  I bought MAC book Air around 2-3 weeks back....it works like a charm...so fast , interfacing is so good....everything is just awesome....Every thing works well, battery back is unexpectedly too good...display is fine, sound quality is clear and loud....and it is superfast...BTW...."

14784,1,"Before buying Macbook, first anaylse your requiremnets. If you want a descent laptop with highest battery backup and which can be easily portable and you don't want it for gaming purpose. Then I must recommend you for the Macbook Air. The 2017 model which I have purchased performs well even when many apps are simultaneously open. Also if you are switching from windows to mac, then you will see the vast differences and you will love it. In short its a perfect laptop for general task such as do..."
14785,5,"first time Mac user, performance wise far better than my old window laptop,look should be improved wrt the bezel rest are good. battery backup mentioned around 12 hour but it's around 8 hour with normal usage which is fine I guess. good for people who want to use premium laptop within reasonable budget."
14786,1,"It is perfect in all ways if anybody want any laptop. Then it is the best because it, itself inspire us to work"
14787,5,"Excellent system for middle class developers. I am a freelancer / mobile developer, I need both android studio and xcode. This system is enough to work with both platforms. Nice packing and delivery by flipkart."
14788,3,thak you apple for such wonderful product with such satisfying price and excellent performance. thanks to flipkart too for too good services. worth buying.
14789,5,Wow the best laptop I have ever used!! It is an excellent piece of work done by apple. Mac os is simply the best os in the world. Once a Mac user always a Mac user.
14790,1,Apple..The name is enough to describe it's experience. it's awesome ... Very slim and smooth surface. just in love with it.
14791,2,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.
14792,4,"Awesome product at such great price. On Flipkart got it with gud price tag, as compared to market with complete authenticity of product by Flipkart. Nicely packed and delivered by special delivery process by Flipkart.Purchased on 3 Sept and got delivered on 4 sept, Great delivery process by Flipkart."
14793,5,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"
14794,5,"worth every Penny!  Apple ! Till now I used to work on Windows but after MacBook my views are completely change about apple products and seriously I love my MacBook, the way it's working never stuck no complain , lightening fast , hazel free charging problem and led backlit keyboard and last but not the least it's design, the features , security and operating system attracts me to work.  and I never get bored to working on it .

14795,2,"Bought it during BBD at around 43.5k,. First of all I would like to thank Flipkart for such a cheap bargain and quick delivery! Coming to laptop most of us know Mac OS is beast, Build quality is awesome and i5 processor is working so smooth like butter for daily tasks!"
14796,5,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
14797,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
14798,5,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
14799,5,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
14800,3,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
14801,4,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
14802,5,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
14803,5,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !
14804,4,"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup."
14805,4,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
14806,5,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
14807,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
14808,5,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
14809,3,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"
14810,3,"Hello,  Here is my Review after 10 days of purchase  Pro : 1.Smoothness 2.Superb battery backup 3. No hang, no lagging 4. After sell support from apple just wow 5. smooth for photoshop  Cons: 1. Charger problem, Overheated (May be in my case Only) 2. For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
14811,5,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1. Four Google Chrome Tabs 2. Three excel sheets 3. Two Word documents. 4. Microsoft Teams 5. Netflix 6. Youtube  I have not been able to find any performance issues so far. The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...
14812,5,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
14813,4,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"
14814,5,"Good product for software developer .when i used this laptop for web development and software development like python and its library its quite good for that.it also good for simple deep learning model creations and data science project . storage is less . its fast compare to windows i5, its smooth compare to windows any machines . but when i used this laptop for virtual machine it is not quite good for that bcz of less storage and i5 processor .when u used this laptop for virtual machine bat..."
14815,5,"I am fully satisfied with this Apple laptop in this price range. Its 2019 manufacturing with original software, excellent battery backup. Thanks to Flipkart & waiting for more offers like this."
14816,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).  Cons: If you are planning to play games....this is not for you, this is a..."
14817,4,"- using for coding and Xcode work well in this - space is little less , we take back in 2 months - design is great - 2017 model we get and registered into apple support website - great for browsing - for photoshop designing not so good"
14818,4,"If you are looking at a laptop with good performance and good battery life and want to do programming this laptop is for you. There are some pros and cons in this laptop.  Pros : 1. The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3. Battery life is good it gives 6-8 hours of battery backup 4. Keypad is very lite and doesn't make soun..."
14819,2,"awesomeness is the word. awesome speed, awesome battery, awesome multi tasking, awesome (light) weight, awesome touch pad (no use of mouse reqd)"
14820,5,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
14821,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
14822,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
14823,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
14824,5,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
14825,4,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
14826,4,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
14827,1,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
14828,4,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
14829,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
14830,4,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
14831,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
14832,2,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind. It's worth every penny your are paying. Everyone know the pros, the only con is screen. But trust me guys display is still awesome. It gives immense pleasure to work on Mac. It's must buy unless you are a gamer."
14833,5,"I got it at 49K, I was planning to buy one from Inspire at 60K. Got it at best possible price, in best possible packing and it got delivered within 3 days from the day I placed an order.  Thanks to Flipkart - Best e-commerce product in India."

Pros Nearly no virus problem Starts very fast Looks so premium and out of the league. Light weight... Conclusion is hardware n build quality is best no point of comparison.  Cons for Windows user Mac OS. Not so user friendly. When u stuck on something u have to do it using script on command prompt linux based.  No HDD only SSD of 128gb No CD Rom N...

Bought it on big billion day offer.Its my first Apple product.Its easier than Windows as per me.It has a very classy look and sturdy built quality.Its very light compared to other laptops.The display is bit low,but we have to sacrifice atleast one to this stunning device.Finally I loved this superb product from Apple and lots of thanks to Flipkart for its good packaging service.Obviously I must rate this product 5‚≠ê."

14837,5,Best
14838,5,"I have been using macbook pro since 2 year. Now on flipkart exchanged with this macbook air at first glance it's pretty good looking device, thin, very light, attractive. Performance is good. Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
14839,5,it's just a nice product
14840,5,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.
14841,3,When open the flap and start it you get the feel of this big package come in small size and elegant design . Finest creation of apple is helping out people to give an unprecedented experience of finesse quality speed performance and user friendly interface alongwith beautiful ergonomic design . Hats off
14842,5,"User friendly, nice design. using it for web development (PHP laravel JavaScript reactjs...) and working beautifully. great product for general use (surfing, movies, office...), not for gaming."

14845,4,It's is quite good n really amazing at 45k budget I love this product but delivery is very late. Battery backup is super very slim n well design n compacted
14846,5,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
14847,4,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
14848,3,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
14849,4,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

14854,5,"genuine apple MacBook received. the inside product packet was well packed however outer box looked very carelessly packed.. ALso the delivery person just ran away without even taking my signature. this is a security flaw , how do we know that packet was handed over to customer. if delivery boys are signing delivery receipt themsleves then it is a big issue. thankfully -I have reveived a genuine August 2018 imported MacBook.

Cons: 1) Battery last only 10 hours on heavy usag..."
14859,4,The product received was well packed and safe. The best part was it was Sept 2019 imported so not that old piece. I basically am not a very heavy user of laptops. Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
14860,4,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
14861,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

14863,5,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.
14864,4,"Classy product. Using MacBook for the first time. Amazing delivery by Flipkart. Got a day before the expected date. It has been just few hours if using and I am loving this.

14883,2,"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. Apple does a great job of integrating their products. Being able to unlock my laptop using my watch is great. It‚Äôs pricy, but I guess you're also paying for the brand When you think of Apple you automatically think expensive if your anything like me. When purchasing this lap..."

14891,5,"I got a faulty product. The delivery was fantastic. Packaging was perfect and the experience of a mac was superb. However, the usb ports do not work for me which is a disappointment. I will now need to carry it to a service centre or apple store and get it replaced. I noticed it a couple days later since I didn‚Äôt try usb. So, this makes my experience a little bitter. Nevertheless good job with the delivery flipkart. Appreciate"

14909,5,"simply. the best laptop. using it for general purpose as well as python programming. has been a delight so far with quick battery charge. ease of use ,sleek looks and amazing performance"
14910,4,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
14911,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"
14912,4,Best for Travel.....very Handy and stylish.... best battery life .... last nearly for 10 to 12 hrs for normal use....
14913,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
14914,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

Unless you are a hardcore gamer and can not afford the price, DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER LAPTOP other than MacBook Air if you ..."

Android studio and xcode runs smoothly without lag. Even emulator of Android studio runs very smoothly. 5. Mag safe port is really good thing.  cons:- 1. Its i5 5th gen which is very old. 2. Display is small but that cannot be considered as cons.  if all pros are there then why just 3 üåü? Because I feel my device is defe...
14926,5,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product. But hey, Apple is really good at giving you a Year of Warranty despite you buy it through an Apple Retailer/Reseller or through an online Reseller like Flipkart does. Though the latter one give..."

14939,5,First time purchaser of an apple product. MacBook is an excellent laptop. No matching no comparisons with its counterparts. Very powerful machine can do most of ur task easily. Well aluminium built body but very light to carry anywhere. Performance is excellent. Battery backup is also very gud . With my first charge I used it for a week. Very satisfied with the product. Apple product standards are unmatched in the market.
14940,5,"Very Efficient Device. Apple devices have strong integration between hardware and software hence even with lower specs on paper, it outperform windows running hardware. This Mac is good enough for daily activity, running programming IDE, emulators etc. Not meant for heavy duty gaming, but 8gb of RAM can handle moderate gaming as well. Most Amazing feature is battery life, unparalleled even when compared to macbook pro. I get 10+ hrs on moderate usage on single charge. Was a steal at 45k, a we..."

Hard disk only 128 GB But these cons are not that sig...
14945,1,Happy with the product & packing was good .  if ur looking for a Sleek and portable laptop with efficient battery then this one is a good pick. Display though is a bit on the lower side unlike the Apple retina display.  Also consider that the laptop doesnt have any lan port or hdmi port.we need to separately purchase the thunderbolt2 converters.The actual apple prices are proced above 1500 bucks.   Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.

15020,4,"Hello there!!! This product really rocks. I don't have to write much about apple products which is known wide already but as a first time MAC user I am very much impressed. To be frank I was worried upon the negative review of this lap top where people have mentioned about heck a lot of complaints on the product build quality and performance. But after using my received item, I feel much satisfied not the laptop. It is just like handling a mobile but in the form of a lap top and very addicti..."
15021,4,Perfectly designed for business travelling people.
15022,5,if you are really serious about display quality then it is quite disappointed for me when i first open and expected a good display .. if you have budget go for retina display
15023,5,Excellent.
15024,5,"amazing build quality, and the screen is not bad, you can increase brightness significantly. I have upgraded from 720p screen and it's around 1080p(not exactly). great product, though slow delivery from flipkart took 9 days.."
15025,5,Genuine product love it
15026,4,"If you love the iOS environment, want superb connectivity with your iPhone, this laptop is the best deal out there. Of course if you have the bucks, the other mac models are awesome too. The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."
15027,5,Good product with this price 56k
15028,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
15029,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...
15030,5,"Worth the penny... I was afraid about the online purchase, but Flipkart didn't made me down. It was all perfect and the MacBook Air- an awesome product by Apple. I love it"

15033,5,Nice product
15034,4,Awesome product ...great...
15035,4,"At 45k pricepoint its the best. Lightweight as name suggests. Ssd quickly opens everything Short on storage (purchase an external hard disk or jetdrive or something like it) Battery backup the best off all laptops, more than 12hrs of backup working on docs and listening songs. Magsafe charges even quickly. Less ports so separate adapters are must Overall bestbuy at this pricepoint"

15039,4,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac. But believe me it's not that difficult. I had few issues in the beginning but you can always Google it and find the solution. Also Flipkart did the good job of delivering it as per promised.

I hope it will not disappoint you if you are thinking buying it. kindly do check about latest model as well. This is 2017 model though you can go with this as it has all the regular updates which Apple provides.
15057,5,It is as amazing as a laptop can be. Buy it for daily use and work purpose. Gaming is not possible. Battery life is phenomenal. Works like a charm and is a 2017 edition. Great buy. Received on time and with great exchange offer.

15060,4,A great product from Apple. I bought it just to give it a try to Mac and now I am never going back to windows ever. Soon I will need a pro version though. The specifications are on a lower side but the experience is so good. Worth every penny.  received a cashback of 10500. Great deal

15077,5,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
15078,3,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.
15079,4,"Thanks Flipkart, Good time delivery. Another apple brand so classic ,so elegant and beautiful. all rumours with this are just wastefull. awesome build quality, look , screen ,work absolutely flowless.  switching myself from window to macbook. Great product by apple at such price. five star."

But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y..."
15081,5,"Macbook air as a product is undoubtedly great. however a word of caution regarding the seller. Not a reliable seller. i bought it from Truecom retail and was sold by sane retails pvt ltd from telangana. when i checked the serial number of the macbook for warranty status on apple website, it showed purchase date not validated and serial number was not mentioned in the invoice. hence it was not showing 1 yr warranty. I contacted flipkart for resolving the issue and i was promised that issue wou..."

15099,3,"light , fast and easy to handle, good purchase"
15100,5,"No comparison with any other laptop for any task. Best machine for coding, graphic designing and business use. But, If you need a laptop for professional video editing and can spend some more money, Go for Macbook PRO..! Otherwise MacBook Air is best laptop and value for money"
15101,5,Very good
15102,5,"I am a software developer, It works fine for me."

15105,3,"Its Mac so no need to tell anything about the product. But I must tell about Flipkart. delivery was fast, nicely packed. after two months all of a sudden my mac charger stop working, may be my bad luck. I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
15106,5,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...
15107,5,"First of all thanks to flipkart for big billion day and quick delivery. Got the product for 43500/-, one of the best deal.  No doubt that machine performs well. No heating issues and quite easy to carry around. Good battery backup as well. If may feel a bit of difficulty in using the machine initially is you are from a windows world. But it just takes few hours to familiarize and then you will enjoy the ride"
15108,5,This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...
15109,5,Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free. Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.

Display was not working but my good luck that it was still in warrenty and thus they have replaced motherboard and it started working again and after exactly one year I'm facing same issue but this time they told me that I need to replace the motherboard which coast me 42000.  I suggest not to buy this laptop.
15131,5,"I've purchased this laptop for 45k during big billion day sale and I was lucky to get it at that unbelievable price. Talking about the laptop, in 2018 it is outdated with the hardware and the design but still, it is the best buy if you got this 3 major aspects before going for a laptop : 1) Long battery life 2) Light Weight 3) Versatile Then go for it without thinking about anything else. Yeah, it is not for the gamers. I use it regularly for coding, web and movies and it is doing pretty awes..."

After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."

But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."

15174,5,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
15175,4,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
15176,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
15177,5,It work slow
15178,4,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
15179,4,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
15180,3,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
15181,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
15182,4,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
15183,5,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
15184,5,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
15185,5,"Good service , good product, Happy with Purchase..."
15186,4,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
15187,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."
15188,4,I am using it for 3 years. So far the best experience with Apple.
15189,4,I agrer that not all with believe... but after one year you will face issue while turning the PC ON...U go to Apple Store and you willl find 5-6 persons around u complaining samr thing.. Better have another option

15195,5,If you want performance only go for it... Good for programmers
15196,3,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"
15197,4,"Perhaps my biggest purchase online, thank u Flipkart for the offer on the product, speed is lighting fast and needless to talk much about apple which is world acclaimed. Happy to have bought the product and serves my purpose of drafting on the go"
15198,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
15199,5,so good
15200,5,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
15201,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class

15232,5,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."
15243,1,"I purchased this on oct 2018. From that time I got 3 times issue. Now it is out of warranty and costing of repairing is 49,000/-. I am not happy with the product. Really very disappointed."
15244,4,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future

15301,4,No doubt it's an amazing product. But the laptop started switching off without power on. Then I had to goto the service enter and they found the connection to the battery inside the laptop was loose and hence it was not charging. Didn't expect this from an apple product.

15355,5,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
15356,4,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

15382,4,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
15383,3,Awesome
15384,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
15385,2,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!
15386,4,sexy and hot
15387,4,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
15388,1,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
15389,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
16026,4,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.

16044,4,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
16045,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
16046,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
16047,4,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
16048,5,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.

16050,4,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
16051,5,Impressive!!!
16052,2,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
16053,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
16054,4,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
16055,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
16056,3,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
16057,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
16058,4,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
16059,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
16060,4,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
16061,4,nice product.fast deliver....love it
16062,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
16063,4,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
16064,4,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
16065,5,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
16066,4,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
16067,3,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
16068,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
16069,5,nice prodect
16070,5,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
16071,5,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
16072,3,Good product but price varies
16073,5,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
16074,3,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
16075,5,Great
16076,5,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
16077,3,Amazing quality
16078,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
16079,4,Very nice products.
16080,5,Good but price high
16081,5,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
16082,4,Perfect
16083,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
16084,5,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
16085,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
16086,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
16087,4,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
16088,5,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
16089,4,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
16090,1,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
16091,5,charget not found
16092,5,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
16093,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
16094,3,I think window is better system Crashes
16095,5,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
16096,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
16097,3,Superb product
16098,5,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
16099,1,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
16100,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
16101,5,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
16102,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
16103,4,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
16104,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
16105,4,Stunningly superb
16106,5,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
16107,3,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
16108,5,bettery performance not upto the mark
16109,5,It's a good product but not value for money
16110,4,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
16111,2,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
16112,5,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
16113,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
16114,5,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
16115,5,not good quality
16116,4,awesome product saves lot of time
16117,5,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
16118,5,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
16119,5,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

16127,1,Best laptop in 48k...
16128,4,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

16154,1,"Never trust flipkart for these products. After 5 months of the purchase my laptop's motherboard is damaged without any reason at all. The charge doesn't stay even for 5 hours. I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

16158,5,Awesome product Really superior Mac Book in all branded laptop
16159,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

16173,5,"Excellent product by mean of design, power, efficiency. I am not a big supporter of the Apple products since it's service model. But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

16203,5,Just Amazing
16204,5,Good
16205,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
16206,5,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
16207,5,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
16208,4,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.
16209,5,Hard to get familiarised first. Memory space is an issue. Overall good experience

16260,5,Okay
16261,5,"Superb laptop.. Writing review after using a laptop for 7 days. In terms of performance, this is the best laptop u can get in this price range. For coding and business purpose this is a powerful machine. Video editing up to HD can be done easily but 1080p,4k is not preferable on this laptop. Not suitable for games."
16262,5,excellent product and also flipkart service.
16263,4,Awesome..worth every penny
16264,5,Very nice genuine products
16265,5,Awesome

16269,3,A great product!! Came with good packaging and delivered within 4 days!! Quite a laptop!! Love it
16270,1,Nice product
16271,5,A nic packing the packing is very good and I txn to flipcart fro the wolderfull product and there safety measures
16272,5,Got damaged product
16273,5,"It's awesome heating should be resolve, otherwise all is well"
16274,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself
16275,5,No comments !! It's a macbook !!!!!
16276,5,Value for money
16277,5,Best Apple products ever!!
16278,2,Love dis product...... Thank you flipkart for the amazing offers.

16347,5,Awesome laptop in amazing price
16348,5,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
16349,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."
16350,3,Good timely delivery by Flipkart
16351,4,"Always wanted to buy a MacBook. Purchased for 59k.  Although the model runs down to 2017, still worth every penny in 2020.  Comes updated with latest Mac OS Catalina 10.15."

16372,5,After using for more than 6 months I can say the product is good. Good for normal uses and weather home or office. In this price the product is good..but if some one looking for best Processor more than i5 Or long video edits or longer time cpu usage may this will not meet you requirements.
16373,1,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app). Literally, I am getting 12 hours of battery. There is no issue of heating...."

16402,5,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october. I received it in new condition. I checked :  1. Delivery is good 2. Serial number matches with apple box and also warranty start on shipping date which is 27 3. No sratch or dent on macbook 4.

I had many negative thoughts regarding the seller ...as when I researched about the seller i.e. ""True Com Retail"" , there were many negative feedbacks from the customers ....but I took the risk and ordered this MacBook at approx 60k...in the Big Diwali Sale. When the delivery agent gave me the product...I noticed that the seal of the flipkart on the outer package w..."
16411,4,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
16412,5,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
16413,4,Awsm!
16414,5,The laptop is really good sleek design compact laptop but the charger and laptops heats really fast while charging and also when I‚Äôm using it.....

16430,4,It's quite wiser to pay more for product from Apple like MacBook Air. Flawless design and performance.

16436,4,"Slimmest, Display is above average but battery is fantastic... design is awesome."
16437,5,"Battery lasts only 6 hours with latest Mac os Catalina 10.5.6. My new Mac came with it. And now battery is only about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, its great."
16438,5,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
16439,5,Amazing
16440,5,Good perched
16441,3,One if the best purchase
16442,4,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
16443,5,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.

16448,2,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.

16456,1,This is so awesome üòä
16457,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.

16485,5,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.

16512,3,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
16513,5,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
16514,1,Nice product

16522,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
16523,5,Worthy of money
16524,1,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
16525,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
16526,1,Fall in love with this
16527,1,Good
16528,5,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
16529,2,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
16530,1,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
16531,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
16532,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
16533,1,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
16534,4,Nice product
16535,1,"Great product, my daughter love it."
16536,5,Best
16537,3,Just wow... Awesome Apple Mackbook. Thank you Flipkart.

16540,5,Worth
16541,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
16542,4,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
16543,3,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
16544,4,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
16545,1,Good
16546,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
16547,1,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
16548,4,good
16549,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
16550,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
16551,4,Macbook air is awesome.
16552,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
16553,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
16554,4,Best
16555,4,Superb Performance... As always Mac
16556,4,Very good...it is mind-blowing
16557,4,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
16558,3,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
16559,5,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
16560,4,Good
16561,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
16562,3,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
16563,3,Great product. Just loving it.
16564,5,Nice
16565,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
16566,2,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
16567,4,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
16568,2,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
16569,2,sometimes the speakers are not working
16570,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
16571,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
16572,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
16573,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
16574,5,Very good
16575,1,Good Product.
16576,5,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
16577,4,Beautiful
16578,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
16579,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
16580,3,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
16581,5,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
16582,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

16622,1,Kya bolu it's amazing laptop i ever used
16623,5,Product worth the price Good for business purposes only Not good for editing color grading video editing like that because of the display resolution
16624,5,"Best quality, worth of money."
16625,5,A wonderful product.
16626,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
16627,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
16628,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
16629,5,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
16630,3,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
16631,3,Great laptop even in 2020
16632,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

16814,5,just amazing than i expected..it is just crowd puller laptop when you go to public places.feels so premium no windows laptop can compete this laptop in design performance .

16821,4,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
16822,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
16823,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind

17408,5,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.

17540,4,"it's iconic, it's perfect one for getting into the Mac family. new MacBook Air is not worthy enough to choose over this. surely screen is not upto date but way better than many PC's also perfect for a student. to be frank I had no expectations on it as it being a very old machine overall but in my usage I found it to be better than all PC's of that price range. all I want to say is ""IT IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC"""
17541,5,Tnx
17542,4,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

17998,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
17999,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
18000,2,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
18001,1,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
18002,5,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
18003,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
18004,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
18005,5,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."

18007,5,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.

Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
18022,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
18023,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
18024,3,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
18025,5,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
18026,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
18027,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
18028,5,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
18029,4,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
18030,5,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
18031,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
18032,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
18033,4,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
18034,4,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit .

18036,1,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
18037,4,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
18038,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
18039,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1. First ever in stock android I've seen companies software not ..."
18040,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
18041,4,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
18042,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
18043,5,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
18044,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
18045,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
18046,4,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
18047,5,Best phone for normal usersüíØ.  üî¥Note:- This is the review after using it for 1 day.

18048,3,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
18049,5,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
18050,2,"Build quality 5  Display 5  Colors 3  Storage capacity 5  Performance 4 (Because phone becomes slightly slow while performing multiple functions)  Camera 4 (Because night clicks are not at all up to the mark, daylight shots are clean but you get best quality only in 64 pixel shots, normal clicks would have been better)  Battery 5 absolutely amazing.  Worth the price?10 stars....!! Definitely yes... Amazing phone you can get in this price compare to other brands.  If you are looking for be..."
18051,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."

18053,1,"Very good Phone for gifting to elders, because of super clean software with no spoofs, a very long lasting battery and super fast and responsive display. Excellent for doing everyday tasks. Not so good for performance tasks,or for camera folks"
18054,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."
18055,5,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.

Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good. One ..."
18058,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
18059,5,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
18060,1,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
18061,4,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
18062,5,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
18063,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
18064,3,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
18065,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
18066,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
18067,5,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
18068,4,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
18069,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
18070,3,Hmm... Well it's good for less usage definitely not recommending to people who always stick on their phonesüçÅ best for mothers and grandparents kind of...
18071,5,Wonderful product of Motorola G30 very best quality and best performance really i am very happy to purchase this product fully satisfied in this prices Very very thank you so much flippant. Com online shopping companies are very best and bileeve for my next shopping programs
18072,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
18073,5,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
18074,5,The most attractive part of this phone is its battery backup..nice premium quality photos and interesting features in it..overall loved the phone and would say its too good and evry penny spent on it is worth it
18075,4,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."

18077,4,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes.

18081,5,"Excellent device at this price. I bought this as my secondary phone mostly to netflix and other stuffs. Battery backup on screen time is 12+ hours on a full charge which is amazing. Camera is good, not the best but works Excellent with Google camera so you can download from xforum.

18083,4,"SD 662 is decent processor for day to day work, work very well. No issues while operating mobile phone. Build quality is also very nice. Two major issues, 1. Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again. Motorola need to work on processing speed otherwise it's just waste of money. 2. Brightness: Very week. Bt ..."
18084,4,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand.

18085,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
18086,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.

18089,2,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."

18091,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.  Google has taken care of every small detail like haptics, microphone, speakers minimalistic ..."
18092,3,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs. 2. Slow charging. Since Motorola is providing Turbocharger, but I don't know why it takes about 4 hrs to charge fully, and discharge within 7-10 hrs. 3. Camera quality. So many functions are there for camera, but they are useless if resolution and dpi is ..."

18184,3,Good phone for this price
18185,5,"Performance is good. Battery lasts for 30hrs for an average usage on 4g. Camera quality is average , you need to edit settings for better picture. In colour shots is working. Almost using 100+ apps on it . Touch & screen quality is best. Hybrid sim slots but am using two sims instead of MMC card. Finger print sensor is a quick. Face unlock is a bit slow. Have played games without a lag ...I have ordered dark pearl 64 gb ."
18186,5,Awesome phone.. Thanks Flipkart
18187,5,"Overall great phone. But, even the Dark Pearl color is a lot light shade. It looks more like silver under bright light."
18188,3,Fantastic phone with amazing features at reasonable price
18189,5,Good for the price. Stock android experience Camera 2/5
18190,4,Was expecting a better product considering Motorola as a brand ..  Camera is worse ... Video playing experience is bad too.  20 watt charging takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to full
18191,5,"Until now I used Moto G (Firsts Generation) for almost 7 years now and it still works like a charm.. but to upgrade I bought this new Moto G30 thinking it is going to be far better than its predecessors, but it's the worst phone ever by motorola. It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."
18192,5,Good Delivery Service.
18193,5,I just love everything about this phone Every thing on it it's super....!!
18194,5,Good mobile.
18195,5,"I am editing this review after 6months of usage.  At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."
18196,5,"Hybrid slot, not good compare to other phones. Camera also not good. Hanging problem"
18197,4,Very best quality
18198,4,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
18199,4,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."
18200,4,This phone is very good
18201,4,Nice product good quality thanks to Flipkart
18202,5,Very bad battery backup... Hang problem...
18203,4,Over-all nice performance with stock android. SATISFIED ü§ó
18204,5,Best quality products
18205,5,"Does the job.  Pros: Battery. Large display. Android version.  Cons: Llittle lag while using multiple apps at a time. Camera is not up to the mark but fine for this price. Display is not HD+, for this price they can at least provide HD+ display.  Final verdict: Good mobile packed with everything for a reasonable price."
18206,5,very nice product
18207,5,"Phones overall performance is good at this price segment, but their camera performance in like 24 mega pixel .."
18208,5,Not good this phone battery is not good

18226,5,"Cemera is definitely good, display could have been full hd, but is good & battery lasts 1 day for me( uses internet a lot, especially YouTube & OTT platforms). For this price its value for money."
18227,1,For the amount‚Ä¶its a killer phone‚Ä¶if you have kids at home and need a phone for their online class and other activities‚Ä¶go for it‚Ä¶!!!
18228,1,The phone looks awesome. The stock android gives clear UI to experience. Loved the way Motorola competing against the Chinese brands.
18229,3,Overall Good phone
18230,4,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
18231,5,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
18232,4,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...
18233,4,"The display is not up to the mark, and the camera is not at all good."
18234,5,Better phone üëå
18235,2,"I think this is by far the best phone out there in this price range only because of its clean and near stock user interface. No bloatware, No BS. Just plain stock experience."
18236,3,This is my 6th moto phone in last 11 years. Still the same quality.
18237,5,Camera quality ok
18238,1,Camera is 64mp but its not good .clearity of camera was disappointed... Not upto the mark and picture clearity is not good. Worst camera clearity and features.
18239,5,It's really a great purchase üòåüòå
18240,5,Camera is poor First week battery performance is very low after update your battery life increases and it performs better.
18241,5,nice product
18242,2,Camera is poor... Mi13mp camera is far better than this phone  Display quality is not as expected  Overall average performance not sooo good as they described
18243,4,"Very slow, heavy and poor camera phone"
18244,4,Little bit bulky rest all is ok for my purposes
18245,5,"Color option could be better. Overall, nice product."
18246,5,Not happy with camera while using whatsapp. Kindly refund my money Not happy with Flipkart
18247,5,mobile is good but battery backup very bad whenever u charge full it's only take 6to 7 hr to down
18248,5,The phone is very handy light weight perfect for a normal use great buy ...moto never dissapoints
18249,5,Don't buy this product
18250,5,Good camera
18251,4,Value for money
18252,4,"Worst Battery. Didn't even used the phone, but the battery drains like crazy. Really disappointed."
18253,5,Phone is a bit heavy also I had to pull off the screen guard as it was a printed one. I had to buy another proper screen guard.
18254,5,Super
18255,5,Battery capacity low and camera üì∑ average Nice looking attractive üòòüòòüòò
18256,3,All things are awesom But camera is 64 mp it's just number not actull 64 mp like 24 or 32 mp . And other perfomence is awesom
18257,5,"very good performance ,and ghank you flipkart"
18258,4,Takes 3 hr to get fully charged. Battery drains a bit faster. Camera is bad in low light. Go for another options with this price range.

18260,5,Waste of money
18261,3,Very nice mobile i love it moto

18263,4,"Stock android experience , worth the money"
18264,5,Overall worth.
18265,4,Good product compared to it's price. I think this is the first device to have advanced security(Think shield) for budget device. SAMSUNG provides knox security only for premium device
18266,1,Very good mobile! When I bought this phone gpay QR code does not work now the problem is solved by Motorola updated thank you Motorola network speed is little slow may be because of processor hope this will also solve soon I love the phone 'cause the name is MOTOROLA!
18267,4,"One of the best quality mobile at reasonable price. It is definitely better than MI, VIVO, REALME & OPPO"
18268,5,Best in this range for social use If u want to play heavy games then u add more 2 to 3 k u can go for better options
18269,5,Camera performance is not as per aspectation and left all thing is perfectly fine.

18285,4,I am not satisfied this product
18286,5,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
18287,1,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
18288,5,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
18289,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
18290,5,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
18291,1,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.
18292,5,Network quality very bad
18293,1,Value for Money
18294,5,"Highly recommended handset , working well with recent updates , my wife live this"
18295,5,Lock button & phone speed performance having problem...seems phone hang even with low number app's...Poor performance Not as expected
18296,4,"Poor network, touch not working properly. Return policy"
18297,5,"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
18298,5,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
18299,5,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."
18300,2,Average performance
18301,4,Camera quality is poor...don't buy from flipkart..they don't refund the money

18310,5,"Mobile hanging, while Gpay barcode scanner unable to scan again hang, after taking image, while image open again hang, sound on full volume became broken speaker like sound come, one Sim and one memory card or 2 Sim at a time, camera image size around 4-5mb by which stores more space on mobile memory. selfy camera image quality not good"
18311,5,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
18312,3,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
18313,4,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .

18317,5,"Looking very cheap. Camera also not so good. My Mi A2 is better in terms of looks, performance and camera except battery."
18318,5,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
18319,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
18320,5,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
18321,5,Display worst better Don't buy this
18322,5,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
18323,5,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

18330,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
18331,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."
18332,1,"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

18373,5,Good nice phone
18374,5,"Terrible phone !! Screen display is average, camera is below average. Not worth the hype and doesn't do justice to hard earned money. I tried to return it on Flipkart but didn't work out, was left with no option but to order another phone of redmi....it's a pity that money is wasted"
18375,4,"After using turbocharger for two hours, the battery does not get charged to 100%. It gets discharged very fast. I replaced my earlier phone mainly for this reason. Thoroughly disappointed."

18382,4,"Don't buy this phone ,at this price it is completely waste of money , it's processor is worst, coming to camera it's 64 mp takes piks like 2 mp zoom is waste only again coming to the battery not even giving backup for one day also with no use finally I would like to say you that ,this mobile is worst,üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞even while uploading these images I got problem s,I am not happy with this phone"

18385,5,"This product is really good, no extra ads, or extra formalities but battery performance is not satisfied in 97% charging - 0% till 3-4 hr so backup is very poor."
18386,4,Flipkart giving faulty product and then they even not getting any responsibility
18387,1,worst camera  Back camera 64 mp is equal to 8 mp Front camera 13 MP is equal to vga camera IE... 1.3 mp  Excluding the above everything is good

18389,5,1.Heating problem 2. Slow processing 3.Taking time to open Camera 4.Take too much time to charge
18390,4,Not bad in this price range.
18391,5,Battery drains quickly. doesn't have the impression of 5k mah battery. It provides only 22 hrs with minimal usage and discharges from 14 to 20 percent during night even no apps running in background and mobile data is off. Also has heating issue as the temperature raises up to 46 celcius with light game only. Tried to replace the product but very poor benchmarking during evaluation. My fate to use.
18392,5,Camera is not good
18393,5,"I'm sure the camera is not 64MP,it's a trick to attract people"

18492,5,Review after using for 3 months:  Pros: 1. Definitely lives up to motorola's legacy of solid build quality 2. Awesome performance without any overheating (1 hour of BGMI makes it heat slightly but not overheat) 3. Superb battery life (consumed only 3% battery on playing BGMI for 30m) 4. Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1. Camera is decent overall with great shots in day and night light but performs...

Clean and smooth UI 2. Good battery and fast charging 3. Water resistant

19451,3,Best budget friendly mobile from Moto. The display is quite big and not fit in one hand easily. The camera is much better than Samsung mobile of same range and battery performance is good too.If you like big screen with in 10k you can go for this .
19452,3,In this price range this is one of the best smartphone available on flikart. The camera is also good with night vision available.
19453,5,"The phone is very bad in all aspects . To start with.  1. Camera : The cameras both front and Back are very bad , blurred and low light and no clarity. They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4. FlipKart: Product look's like a duplicate product, and flipkart return policy is worst, there is no returns and refund for the product purchased  My humble suggestion please do not see the ratings..."

19458,5,"Being a Moto user and Moto lover since 6 years, I must say I'm disappointed. Very bad experience with Moto e7 plus since 2 months. Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."
19459,4,Best phone with affordable price and it's is having best battery üîã and camera is not so good but some where it is good. On the other hand body to screen retio is so good so that go for it....
19460,5,"Overall this phone is great but there are so many features that are missing like audio recording, fm, etc. The most annoying feature is call recording come on why do someone need to know that im recording the call. As soon as you click record it loudly say 'the call is been recorded' except that everything is fine. Camera is good, display is HD+ hardly you will notice any difference. Battery is decent, I like this phone for the UI."

19463,5,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."
19464,5,Good product Worth for its pricing Nice camera especially night mode very helpfull Decent front camera Battery too good Display ok but if they would have given FHD + great Not for gamers Feels good for daily usage with moto gestures No Ads..

19465,5,Phone is excellent for the price range.. camera isn't like Samsung but is not bad.. battery is very good. Buy back cover sametime..not available at shops etc.. Overall phone is worth buying

19664,5,"Phone has a bad network issue , call break many times never show full network, even i requested for return or replacement but their 3rd party (jeeves) support person came for phone inspection is totally uneducated who deven doesn't know the meaning of network, totally useless phone and waste of money on flipkart."
19665,3,Moto E7 Plus is a third class quality phone. Front Camera is very very very Poor. While on a call many other apps get open automatically. Call auto connect to anyone in between of a call from search directory. Restart take 4 to 5 mins. I will not recommend to anyone to go for this worst product.
19666,3,Camera quality is very bad & not return policy
19667,5,Nic
19668,5,"Its worst mobile I have bought, it's front camera is not working whenever u open it, mobile gets restarted own its own. No support from Flipkart they r asking to visit service centre which is 70+km from my place. I got struck after buying this scrap. Worst from moto,no quality checks at all"

I have been waited so long for Motorola mobile but after purchasing it happened.

Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

21155,5,Hey guys I have used this phone for almost 20days So the review are based on it  Camera -3/5 The camera quality must be improved amd it's quite low quality time and for videos I will give 1/5 because it's too poor quality Anyways I can take satisfactory pics.  Performance of - 4/5  The reason behind this is sometimes the device works slowly. I have a problem with its Wi-Fi and sometimes network because it is slow and sometimes it doesn't open.   Battery is 5/5 Ekdam mast hai bhai log...

The phone supports 18w micro USB fast charging, but the the 10w charger is good and I would suggest use the in box charger.

21852,2,Super phone
21853,1,Worst mobile...... Not recommended any body
21854,1,"Don't believe on YouTube reviews, I'm using this mobile and it's a good phone. If you are looking for a mobile phone for your parents then this can be an excellent choice. It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."
21855,4,"Great phone for price range great camera and battery display is also good nice performance also the charging is also fast, overall 5/5 I will update reviews regularly this is after 2 days of use. Back cam has modes like slowmotion and more. Which is good thanks flipkart for 3 day delivery."

22336,1,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time. The best part of this device is its premium feel in this range with the solid packaging of the device qhen you use it continuously.

22527,1,Camera doesn't seem like 48mp. Screen brightness is low. Difficulty is there in day light. Rest all are good. Value for money. Still the best option in 8-9k range.
22528,5,"If display is of higher quality the mobile will be a great one. If you compare same configuration mobiles from other brands this is the best one as this mobile offers 48MP Camera, 5000mah, 4GB RAM, Clean UI and mainly Snapdragon 460. If you want to buy it go for it. It is the besst mobile under the price range."

22832,4,Display: One gets a very clear display on this device. Good for streaming and gaming.  Battery: Little disappointed by the battery. Says it 5000mAh but doesn't last that long. Though it's good.  Camera: set the camera manually and the results are amazing. Slow motion videos are pretty good. Also Selfie camera is impressive.  Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
22833,5,Best phone in this price
22834,5,Best budget phone in this price
22835,4,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
22836,5,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

No case in Box, No Secondary Microphone But it Takes better photos than the MOTO G9!!! It blows my mind. Compared Well lit and Low lit Photos. In Moto E7 plus, I just have to take a single shot and can expect the photos to look good whereas there is focusing issues in the G9."

22966,4,Nice but Not Very Nice
22967,3,Received today...Ok as of now will review after a week usage Everyday I am hating this mobile after 2 weeks Iam done..such waste from motorola... Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
22968,5,Very good product
22969,3,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
22970,5,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
22971,4,Overall superb mobile at this price
22972,5,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it
22973,5,Product is good but delivery was late
22974,1,Bad camera of back side..it has mirrarcast problem in all phones..I think some of money will west to invest.. My suggestion is don't to buy did product

22992,1,Nice model for mid range users...
22993,1,Better
22994,5,Camera is cheap
22995,1,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
22996,5,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
22997,3,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."

23016,5,Ok Ok
23017,1,Nice phone...
23018,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
23019,5,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
23020,5,Good products üëç
23021,5,"Super, Value for money.."
23022,1,Most mind choice mobile
23023,2,Stock android no bloatwares and a decent camera. All in all a good buy.
23024,1,Great product for this price tag!
23025,1,Good in price
23026,5,Budget king
23027,5,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
23028,1,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
23029,5,Awesome product
23030,4,do not buy completely waste this product
23031,2,Just awesome
23032,1,It is amazing mobile
23033,1,Nice but company should provide earphones also
23034,5,Alike professional
23035,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
23036,1,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
23037,2,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.

23153,3,"Battery is not good. If using the net, the battery backup is 12 to 15 hrs. Battery charging takes 7 to 8 hours, very slow charging speed. My Moto G4 Play was better than this, it used to charge fast."
23154,5,Nice product
23155,4,Battery and performance is good . it's a most value for money rather than other brands .I like the stock android
23156,1,"No fast charging option. No back case provided in the package, poor package. Phone seems to be good at this price. If possible will try to write a review after few days of usage.."
23157,1,Just wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è you can go for it
23158,4,ph is good
23159,5,Cool phone.... Performs over the mark and under the budget Delivery was fast too
23160,1,"Camera is crap. Display is also bad. Good things are like bloatware free almost stock Android experience, big battery with 64 GB storage. It's not a value for money product compared to other offerings at this price point. Mi & Realme can offer more value. You can go for this phone only if you're a stock Android fan & you don't wanna use custom UI."

23167,2,I think if you don't want hesitate buying Chinese phone you have better options . Not gonna lie screen looks so dull and camera is just for name sake 48 mp result are worst. Build quality looks good and stock android are only pro.

23176,5,Display is good but camera and phone body quality could have been better. It‚Äôs too big. Instead of focusing on length they could‚Äôve improved body quality otherwise it‚Äôs worth the money.

23222,2,"Pros : 1.) Good phone for this price and that too with Android stock experience. 2.) Decent Camera  Cons: 1.) Bit surprised to see, the package didn't contain a headset, eventhough the device supports 3.5 jack 2.) Would have been nice, if there was a dedicated memory slot, rather than messing up with the 2nd sim slot.  My intention was to upgrade my Nokia feature phone which I bought in year 2012 which is still in working condition, with its original battery and so on. Ex..."

23249,5,Thanks Flipkart for super fast delivery. Writing this review after using the phone around two weeks.  Pros:- 1. STOCK ANDROID!!! 2. Robust design. 3. Good battery backup. 4. Great speakers. 5. Water resistant upto some extent as rubber sealing can be seen in sim tray. 6. Cleverly designed to match the updated look of quad camera phones only with two camera.  Cons:- 1. Can't use net while calling. 2. Camera not upto the mark. 3. Body to screen ratio not optimised. 4. Slow net connectivity. 5....

23251,5,"For a price range of 9k this is a very decent phone without any bloatware. The user interface is very smooth, easy to understand and without any nonsense extra settings like the mi phones.  The phone is highly recommended for the elderly who has very basic usage - YouTube, Spotify, WhatsApp,Google,Camera and any other social media apps. It's not quite smooth for heavy gaming but it works just fine with few lags. So if you're okay with that, go ahead.  Also, the display is well arranged by Mo..."

23267,5,Simply Awesome 1. The quad cam technology which gives the clarity picture of 48MP. 2. The stock android which provides ad-free and bloatware usage of mobile. 3. Long lasting battery. 4. Night vision.

23291,2,"Cons: 1. You can't use internet while you're on a call, that means there's no dedicated inbuilt modems. (These inbuilt modems are pre-installed and are available even on low-end smartphones, never expected this from motorola)  2. The camera's clarity and efficiently is not upto the mark. (Even my brother's RedMI 5A is capturing photos with more clarity.. but this doesn't seem like a 48MP camera, and auto capture is so embarassing with it's delayed recognition.  3.

Mobile Touch is also good. So if you are looking for good specification phone from 8K-10K, this is nice phone. Go for it..... Request to Moto, they should provide at least phone front screen guard with the mobile."
23329,5,It's good but length is big to hold in hand. Hybrid sim slot is a drawback.. u can put one sim and 1 memory card only. .if u want to put another sim..need to remove one of them.. Gesture mode also there..good some times

23332,4,Not bad
23333,2,I bought this phone in the flash sale and it works amazingly. The screen is long and beautiful. It does feel a bit heavy at start but you do get used to it in a day or two. The camera works quite nicely given that this is a budget phone. You get absolutely everything in the least price and a fantastic performance. Go for it.
23334,5,Nice phone middle range
23335,1,"Worst phone ever....camera is not even 8 MP.... front camera has 3GP quality so that one can go 10 years back. No support from Flipkart, the seller and Motorola...this phone is just dumb... do not buy this phone, I repeat do not."

23354,1,Very poor camera inspite of 48 megapixel look like 13 mp and no back options. Front camera unsatisfactory. Heavy phone inspite of 180 GM feel like 200gm.

23384,5,"First of all i was suprised because it was more than the size which i expected.. And the display keep justice to the price. Battery : once its full charged it will last for a full day. Eventhough its a normal charger but works decently Camera : spot colur option is unique, portrait mode works well at day light, night capture is above avarge Overall expercice is worth for the money if u are looking for a budgetfull fun with some needfull features go for it"

23393,3,Camera clarity like 8mp. Nice products
23394,1,the product is a good budget phone for casual work and not heavy games. you can play heavy games but that would shorten the life of your device. if youre on a tight budget and want a phone for your daily work then it is for you. Hardcore gamers stay away. Camera is decent but the stock android feel and no bloatware is definitely a huge thumbs up for motorola.

Yup, it is worth the price. I bought this for my mom so I'm looking for quality rather than performance. Moto is known for quality. I'm expecting the usage will be good for another 3 years.

23485,2,Very good phone. Reviewing after 1 week of use . Camera is excellent 48MP is really great and stock Android is awesome. And one more thing is Some people think that Snapdragon 460 is week and useless processor but its an awesome processor COD with ultra graphic support through this processor.

23491,4,The Mobile hardware and software both are really good and it's working fine. It's worth for money. There is no 2nd thought about it. Really good with respect to all delivered hardware and software features. BUT...  Disadvantage: 1] The UI accessibility is not user friendly. The UI accessibility is really good in Redmi mobiles - MIUI. The Moto should make the UI like that.  2] The length of the mobile is 6.5 inch. This much size is not needed because it's difficult to keep in the pockets. It...

23529,2,I am using this for 3 days and to be honest moto E7 plus is an excellent value for money offering for one who loves photography and stock android experience. PROS: *Excellent 48mp dual cam without any so called gimmicks but loaded with many useful features like spot colour 360panorama and pro mode. *Excellent night mode which makes a huge impact on clicks. *The main camera photos has a good colour reproduction and sharpness level for the segment. *Despite of and HD+display it has very deep b...

23545,5,"1. High build quality 2. Pure android without bloatware 3. Promising performance from Snapdragon 460(excluding heavy gaming) If you are looking for those qualities, albeit this one is best. Though motorola is owned by Lenovo, motorola still operates from United States. So, don't worry about safety. Everything is ok with this phone. But the battery backup is a bit low considering 5000mah capacity. Although it lasts for a full day."

23560,4,"I received the handset two days ago. The looks of the mobile is very attractive but when it comes to its camera and battery, it is just horrible. The pics of the rear camera which is claimed to be of 48 MP is hazy and full of pixel dots on enlarging the pics. I do not know how people are saying that it takes great pics. To me the pics of my samsung bar phone of 1.5MP camera is as comparable as this one. It is just disgusting. The other main problem which I am facing is a issue with the batte..."

You can proudly say you have non Chinese mobile. 2) Mobile UI (user interface) is so awesome. Touch of phone is so smooth and you would love to playing on it. 3 ) Battery backup is non competeable with any other phone, 5000 mAh is huge capacity and you can use it for around 30 hrs after full charge by doing surfing and ol on thi..."

So this is the fastest delivery which I have got by flipkart.  Camera: This is the best camera phone in this price segment. I have never expected this kind of picture quality at this price.

Display is good, battery is good, looks so good, new type of back going feature is nice, Misty blue color is awesome. But they're some issues with the phone which I want to share. The camera quality is very poor. If take a photo in sunlight is good but in little bit in dark photos are very bad. Camera quality is not up to mark. If I think 48 megapixel will work no it w..."
23750,4,Best budget friendly mobile from Moto. The display is quite big and not fit in one hand easily. The camera is much better than Samsung mobile of same range and battery performance is good too.If you like big screen with in 10k you can go for this .
23751,5,In this price range this is one of the best smartphone available on flikart. The camera is also good with night vision available.
23752,4,"The phone is very bad in all aspects . To start with.  1. Camera : The cameras both front and Back are very bad , blurred and low light and no clarity. They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4. FlipKart: Product look's like a duplicate product, and flipkart return policy is worst, there is no returns and refund for the product purchased  My humble suggestion please do not see the ratings..."

23754,4,"Thanks to Flipkart for excellent packaging with advanced delivery as l have uploaded pictures of my product...Camera is not at all bad, battery nice also..but the signal quality is,it seems to me, little bit poor..May be l am wrong...overall the product is under satisfaction.."
23755,5,"Battery üîã backup good , display good , camera is not good , performance good , network problem , good looking , but no earphone in box within two days received fast delivery tq flipkart"
23756,5,"The display is good, the phone has good weight, feels solid in hand, the processor is decent for day to day use(browsing, internet surfing, etc.) I brought this for my mother and she is happy with it."
23757,5,"Being a Moto user and Moto lover since 6 years, I must say I'm disappointed. Very bad experience with Moto e7 plus since 2 months. Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."
23758,5,Best phone with affordable price and it's is having best battery üîã and camera is not so good but some where it is good. On the other hand body to screen retio is so good so that go for it....
23759,5,"Overall this phone is great but there are so many features that are missing like audio recording, fm, etc. The most annoying feature is call recording come on why do someone need to know that im recording the call. As soon as you click record it loudly say 'the call is been recorded' except that everything is fine. Camera is good, display is HD+ hardly you will notice any difference. Battery is decent, I like this phone for the UI."

23761,4,Nice and amazing product Go for it. Thanks Flipkart fast delivery. Love you Flipkart
23762,5,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."
23763,5,Good product Worth for its pricing Nice camera especially night mode very helpfull Decent front camera Battery too good Display ok but if they would have given FHD + great Not for gamers Feels good for daily usage with moto gestures No Ads.. No Bloatware... Thanks for Stock Android  Finally If you need a practical smart phone  Moto E 7 Plus does all the above
23764,5,Phone is excellent for the price range.. camera isn't like Samsung but is not bad.. battery is very good. Buy back cover sametime..not available at shops etc.. Overall phone is worth buying

23964,5,Moto E7 Plus is a third class quality phone. Front Camera is very very very Poor. While on a call many other apps get open automatically. Call auto connect to anyone in between of a call from search directory. Restart take 4 to 5 mins. I will not recommend to anyone to go for this worst product.

And the most important thing is very poor in signal capturing, somehow I am not able to make any calls and not getting any incoming calls, had to reboot to make any calls, and sometimes even a call gets connected I am facing issues to listen and speak.  Highly disappointed."

I have been waited so long for Motorola mobile but after purchasing it happened.

24355,1,This Motorola E7 plus is simply superb. It's perfect at this cost (below Rs.9000). Decent phone.. Full value for money. 50% Battery stands upto 8 hours of YouTube usage (I would recharge when it comes 50% battery). So with internet usage it will come upto 16 hours or more. Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

26220,4,"Well firstly, battery backup is good but places were this product failed are as follows: Microphone isn't that good at all. And stopped working after 2 weeks Doesn't sit on the collar properly. Even when the volume is full, you won't feel the bass."
26221,5,Nice
26222,5,I don't like the sound quality . I expected much more than this from mivi but i don't feel bass also and the volume is also not good. It should be upto a level but unfortunately it wasn't. The magnet is also not good. That's why i am returning this product

26228,5,Flikart Service & products are bad. Think again before you buy the product
26229,4,"Waste of money, given 2 star because it's Indian company and product. Battery backup is almost nil. Connects and disconnects automatically. Very much irritating during calls. Not comfortable for every day use. Company should not have compromised on quality because of few hundreds"
26230,5,Sound is gud and bass is excellent and. Betry backup so gud.
26231,5,I have used it from the day i haven't found any glitch in this neckband. Honestly its sound quality very clear and bass quality is super awesome. Also it gets charge in 40 mins when i connect it with my 18watt charger adapter and have good playtime last survive upto 8 to 9 hours on single charge
26232,5,Please don't buy this product.this product is very bad
26233,5,One of the best neckband you can buy for under 1000 Advantages -One of the best battery backup for a neckband -Good sound quality for the price -Build quality is also good -Descent bass -Seamless connection -Worth it  Disadvantage -A bit loose(maybe just for me)   Worth the money

30137,1,"Camera better,songs better,blutooth some stacks I am some quality appcet"
30138,5,"Worst! Sim holder is broken, later only I found that, sound quality not good, worst"
30139,5,It is a good product but its touch is not good.
30140,1,Ok
30141,3,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
30142,2,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
30143,3,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
30144,3,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
30145,4,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
30146,1,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
30147,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
30148,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
30149,1,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
30150,3,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
30151,5,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
30152,5,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
30153,5,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
30154,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
30155,5,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
30156,5,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
30157,3,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
30158,5,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
30159,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
30160,5,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
30161,5,wonderful product
30162,5,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
30163,5,awesome.
30164,1,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
30165,5,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
30166,4,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
30167,3,good
30168,5,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
30169,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
30170,3,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
30171,1,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
30172,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
30173,3,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
30174,5,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
30175,5,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
30176,5,Great watch to wear üëå
30177,5,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...
30178,5,"Received duplicate straps (Belt) within 6 to 8 month both belts cut down automatically..... Watch is good, belt cost is 3k...."
30179,3,Loved it
30180,5,"BPM feature is not working, wifi is not getting connected, notification feature fails"
30181,5,they gave used product
30182,5,it's good.
30183,5,nice smartwatch..
30184,2,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
30185,5,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
30186,5,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
30187,5,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
30188,3,Good Product
30189,1,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
30190,5,Nice product
30191,4,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
30192,5,Writing this review after using the product for 9 months . The watch used to work almost satisfactorily for most of the period but there was some noticeable glitch in tracking the heart rate on many occasions . After 09 months it's recording of heart rate became completely erratic . It is abnormally high even during sleep . This error has made the watch completely useless as all the vital stats and features are dependent on accurate tracking of heart rate only .
30193,1,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
30194,5,Not supporting for Notifications.
30195,5,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
30196,5,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
30197,3,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
30198,1,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
30199,5,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
30200,5,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
30201,1,Happy to buy it in billion sale
30202,5,not support all mobile model
30203,5,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
30204,5,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
30205,1,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
30206,5,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
30207,1,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
30208,5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
30209,5,It's a good watch.
30210,1,Very inaccurate and unreliable
30211,3,Good product value for money
30212,5,Full features for this cost is value for money
30213,5,Not good start problem ha
30214,1,Value for money. Good product
30215,4,Ok
30216,5,"The activity tracking is good. But the watch's battery is terrible and barely lasts 2 days. Also, the mechanism to remove and attach the straps is the worst."
30217,5,Battery melted in 2 month time and not getting any support from any where.. flipkart customer support is just waste.. they promise to call in some time but never turned up.. facing issue from 1 month but no prevail. Dont purchase any item like that frm flipkart.
30218,2,Just premium awesome
30219,5,Worst quality of Band...... And accessories not available in local market..... I waste my money after 1 month of use..
30220,5,Battery is draining fast
30221,4,Very good. No compromise on Fitbit quality. Good deal.
30222,5,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
30223,5,Value for money
30224,5,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
30225,5,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
30226,5,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
30227,5,Just okay
30228,5,Excellent watch.
30229,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
30230,1,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
30231,4,Connectivity is very loose
30232,5,Good product
30233,5,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
30234,2,Good product... resonable price...
30235,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
30236,4,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
30237,1,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
30238,5,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
30239,5,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
30240,3,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
30241,1,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
30242,1,Very nice
30243,1,This watch was Awesome
30244,5,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
30245,5,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
30246,3,Worth buying it
30247,5,It is a good product in this price range.
30248,3,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
30249,5,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
30250,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
30251,5,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
30252,1,It's an amazing product
30253,1,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
30254,5,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
30255,1,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
30256,5,Poor battery backup
30257,2,Best watch
30258,4,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
30259,5,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
30260,4,Worth buy and accurate
30261,2,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
30262,1,Bettery keep charging every day
30263,5,After one year display automatically damaged
30264,3,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
30265,2,Worst product no recommended
30266,5,Good watch...looks stylish...
30267,5,Beautiful watch...value for money.
30268,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
30269,4,Good one
30270,1,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
30271,5,Okay product
30272,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
30273,5,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
30274,5,Awsome experience....
30275,5,Good watch
30276,5,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
30277,5,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
30278,5,Not good
30279,5,Waste of buying
30280,5,Nice watch
30281,4,Very nice product...üëç
30282,1,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
30283,5,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
30284,5,"Persistent sync issues, pl don't buy"
30285,5,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
30286,1,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
30287,5,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
30288,5,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
30289,2,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
30290,5,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
30291,1,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
30292,1,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
30293,4,Not good
30294,1,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
30295,4,Good watch
30296,4,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
30297,4,Worth it....
30298,1,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
30299,1,Nice
30300,5,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
30301,2,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
30302,5,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
30303,3,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
30304,1,Great product!!
30305,4,Not value for money..
30306,3,Nice watch
30307,3,Amazing
30308,1,Its value for money
30309,1,Thank you flipkart
30310,5,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
30311,5,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
30312,5,It‚Äôs okay
30313,5,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
30314,4,Good So far...Loving it
30315,5,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
30316,1,Very good
30317,5,Classic watch
30318,3,Good product
30319,5,It's wow
30320,5,Classy product.but battery issue seen
30321,5,Nice watch.....
30322,5,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
30323,4,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
30324,1,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
30325,3,Nice
30326,1,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
30327,3,Nice one
30328,4,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
30329,1,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
30330,5,Don't buy
30331,1,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
30332,5,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
30333,5,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
30334,2,Wonderful bought at 7300
30335,1,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
30336,5,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
30337,1,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
30338,5,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
30339,3,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
30340,5,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
30341,1,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
30342,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
30343,1,Best at this price
30344,5,Good Simple watch.
30345,5,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
30346,4,Nice
30347,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
30348,3,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
30349,5,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
30350,5,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
30351,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
30352,4,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
30353,5,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
30354,3,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
30355,5,Very nice really good product
30356,5,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
30357,4,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
30358,3,No doubt... It's best in class
30359,5,Good one
30360,5,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
30361,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
30362,4,Not much as expected
30363,4,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
30364,1,Best in class
30365,1,Worst don't buy it
30366,4,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
30367,3,This product waste
30368,3,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
30369,3,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
30370,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
30371,5,Not worth of the price
30372,1,syncing problem with iphone
30373,5,Amazing watch!
30374,5,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
30375,5,Poor
30376,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
30377,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
30378,1,Breakage product
30379,4,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
30380,1,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
30381,5,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
30382,3,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
30383,4,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
30384,5,Good product received and worth of money.
30385,1,Totally inaccurate!
30386,5,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
30387,1,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
30388,2,Great watch..durable too
30389,3,Loved it
30390,5,Nice
30391,5,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
30392,5,Money waste
30393,5,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
30394,1,Nyc
30395,5,Very good product
30396,5,Nice watch
30397,5,Nice product
30398,3,Perfect
30399,1,"it's amazing, just go for it"
30400,5,good
30401,5,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
30402,4,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
30403,4,Berry ghatiya product
30404,5,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
30405,5,worth to spend on this product
30406,4,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
30407,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
30408,5,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
30409,2,amazing product
30410,3,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
30411,1,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
30412,5,dont buy this watch. worst product
30413,1,Supergood.
30414,2,best
30415,1,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
30416,1,nice
30417,1,Papa is very happy with the watch
30418,4,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
30419,1,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
30420,4,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
30421,1,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
30422,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
30423,3,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
30424,4,super
30425,5,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
30426,4,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
30427,5,great product
30428,1,I just have praises for this watch
30429,4,base users for a activity trackers
30430,1,loving it.
30431,4,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
30432,4,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
30433,3,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
30434,5,good in all aspects.
30435,3,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
30436,5,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
30437,4,ok
30438,4,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
30439,3,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
30440,5,very good product...
30441,5,Connectivity issue.
30442,4,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
30443,1,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
30444,4,super watch and nice color
30445,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
30446,4,good one
30447,4,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
30448,5,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
30449,5,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
30450,4,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
30451,5,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
30452,5,good one
30453,3,good and accurate
30454,5,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
30455,4,very good
30456,1,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
30457,5,Really good watch worth buying
30458,5,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
30459,1,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
30460,5,worth buying....
30461,4,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
30462,4,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
30463,3,working as per review but little costly
30464,5,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
30465,3,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
30466,4,nice product....
30467,5,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
30468,5,perfect for health reasons
30469,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
30470,5,go for it guys rocking
30471,5,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
30472,4,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
30473,5,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
30474,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
30475,4,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
30476,1,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
30477,5,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
30478,4,good
30479,1,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
30480,5,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
30481,4,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
30482,4,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
30483,1,great product
30484,5,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
30485,5,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
30486,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
30487,5,very good product with great features
30488,5,good watch.... only lacking call facility
30489,5,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
30490,1,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
30491,5,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
30492,1,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
30493,4,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
30494,5,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
30495,1,The product was not as per expectation.
30496,4,genuine product
30497,1,Great product
30498,5,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
30499,5,Nice Watch for the Amount
30500,4,awesome.....
30501,5,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
30502,2,Excellent product... good to go
30503,5,nice product
30504,5,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
30505,1,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
30506,5,worst watch
30507,5,stylish and fantastic
30508,4,ok
30509,4,excellent watch
30510,4,best price and good buy
30511,1,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
30512,5,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
30513,1,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
30514,3,Good
30515,5,"Terrible setup experience. Nothing works seamlessly. And Linux is not supported for music uploads, etc."
30516,5,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !
30517,1,Not connecting for not working properly
30518,5,Nice product
30519,5,very nice
30520,5,Not fully compatible with one plus 6T. Having Notification issue.
30521,5,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
30522,4,Nice watch
30523,4,Very poor quality. Has completely gone dead in one day of usage after factory resetting. Wastage of money.

30540,3,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
30541,4,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
30542,1,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
30543,1,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
30544,1,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
30545,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
30546,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
30547,2,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
30548,2,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
30549,5,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
30550,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
30551,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
30552,5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
30553,4,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
30554,4,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
30555,5,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
30556,3,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
30557,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode
30558,1,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
30559,1,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
30560,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
30561,5,"It's a great deal, images are good, go for it, nice camera for beginners,images videos were amazing, if your budget was less then 30k then go for it don't think to much, I personally liked it. Thanku flipkart for this and for 1 day delivery."
30562,4,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
30563,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
30564,5,"A decent entry level DSLR. Very glad that it was bundled with a carry case.  The lens is decent for beginner level and some advanced level photography.  For the price I bought it, I can not say how glad I am."
30565,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
30566,1,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"

30568,5,Nyc osm fantastic Fabulous pictures quality ls vary vary good in this price range I m gone for 5 star thank you flipkart thank you so much for this camera
30569,1,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
30570,5,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
30571,5,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
30572,1,"I purchased this last in the month of October after using roughly almost 7-8 months I can say this camera is a gem for beginners and for pro guys you'll not dissatisfied with the quality of camera , image capture quality. good battery backup high quality lense high quality cables even carry case is also good yeah bag looks little old fashioned but who cares about the bag when you have very decent camera at this price range"
30573,1,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
30574,1,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
30575,2,A full featured DSLR with a good quality image sensor. It has all the features that are required for a mid level amateur. In skilled hands it is an awesome tool.
30576,1,As like always Canon is perfect in all manner.. super pick by this price range. loved it
30577,5,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
30578,3,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."
30579,2,amazing camera @ such price Range Display pixel is low but clearity in images we seen in mob laptops etc _ Best Camera Recommended for New users Better than my Nikkon D3400
30580,2,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
30581,4,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
30582,1,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
30583,5,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
30584,2,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
30585,4,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
30586,4,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
30587,3,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
30588,5,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"
30589,1,"Best Entry Level DSLR in this range. My first DSLR. Loved It. Good delivery, thank you Flipkart !"
30590,3,"Nice Camera in Great Price, Good for photo passionate"
30591,4,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
30592,1,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
30593,1,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
30594,2,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
30595,4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
30596,2,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
30597,5,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
30598,1,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.

30854,5,Good 1
30855,5,I bought this camera in the year 2018 for 16K giving this review after more than 2yreas of using. Its a complete satisfaction I must say. With its wifi and remote photography options what more can you expect at this price. It a perfect choice for some who wants to learn.
30856,1,"everything reached in a perfect shape without any damage , cam is too good , but should be bought only with the zoom lens, kit lens is not that much useful.features are awesome. it is wifi enabled to share your photos. thorugh wifi u can connect ur mobile ,which can show the live cam screen on your mobile . flash is good i got it at 21500 without zoom lens. upto now there r no reasons to mark it a bad one ,except the reasons to say it is an awesome product at such a price."
30857,1,Good to start
30858,1,"Got it for 20k flat ! Excellent product for beginners and learners ! It even comes with a free learning courseware subscription the box ! Only thing tou need to take care is that the Mount ring lacks steel reinforcement, so lens changes need to be carefully done...."

30896,1,Nice
30897,3,Too good
30898,3,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...

30921,4,Camera is amazing. But i didn't get memory card and bag with it so a lil bit disappointed. But overall the camera is awesome Ho for it i got is for 22k I'd suggest you to buy it in big billion days you may get it for 18 to 19k rupees.
30922,4,If you're Planning to buy this camera for video shoot then you are going to do a big mistake because it's video quality is too much poor .
30923,5,Very nice camera... But main thing is that I don't know some of its functions so after using 3-4 months I will give my review again
30924,5,Blur system is very good
30925,3,Good
30926,5,Good product
30927,5,So Nice.I love this

30933,1,Good
30934,3,Very good photo
30935,1,Wast of mony
30936,5,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
30937,5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
30938,4,Excellent product
30939,5,Always guves a crisp image. Best for beginner. And I am a beginner.
30940,1,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
30941,5,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
30942,3,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."
30943,5,At this price..it is okay.but if you are expecting professional quality fotography then it is not for you..Go for some higher price model.
30944,1,Good product
30945,5,Excellent product the picture is much more good
30946,1,Very good

They said there is 30x optical zoom whereas it only zoom upto 3x with 18-55mm lens, so it is my humble request to FLIPKART sales team to review the description once on their end before putting it on website."
